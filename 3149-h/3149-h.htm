EDEN PLACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Eden Place</span> was a short street
running at right angles with Eden Square, a most unattractive and
infertile triangle of ground in a most unattractive but
respectable quarter of a large city.&nbsp; It was called a
square, not so much, probably, because it was triangular in
shape, as because it was hardly large enough to be designated as
a park.&nbsp; As to its being called &lsquo;Eden,&rsquo; the
origin of that qualifying word is enveloped in mystery; but it is
likely that the enthusiastic persons who projected it saw visions
and dreamed dreams of green benches under umbrageous trees, of a
green wire fence, ever green, and of plots of blossoming flowers
filling the grateful air with unaccustomed fragrance.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the trees had always been stunted and
stubby, the plants had never been tended, and all the paint had
been worn off the benches by successive groups of working-men out
of work.&nbsp; As for the wire fence, it had been much used as a
means of ingress and egress by the children of the neighbourhood,
who preferred it to any of the gateways, which they considered
hopelessly unimaginative and commonplace, offering no resistance
to the budding man of valour or woman of ambition.</p>
<p>Eden Place was frequented mostly by the children, who found it
an admirable spot to squabble, to fight, and to dig up the
hapless earth; and after them, by persons out of suits with
fortune.&nbsp; These (generally men) adorned the shabby benches
at all times, sleeping, smoking, reading newspapers, or tracing
uncertain patterns in the gravel with a stick,&mdash;patterns as
uncertain and aimless as themselves.&nbsp; There were fewer
women, because the unemployed woman of this class has an
old-fashioned habit, or instinct, of seeking work by direct
assault; the method of the male being rather to sit on a bench
and discuss the obstacles, the injustices, and the unendurable
insults heaped by a plutocratic government in the path of the
honest son of toil.</p>
<p>The corner house of Eden Place was a little larger than its
neighbours in the same row.&nbsp; Its side was flanked by a
sand-lot, and a bay window, with four central panes of blue
glass, was the most conspicuous feature of its
architecture.&nbsp; In the small front yard was a microscopic
flower-bed; there were no flowers in it, but the stake that held
up a stout plant in the middle was surmounted by a neat wooden
sign bearing the inscription, &lsquo;No Smoking on these
Premises.&rsquo;&nbsp; The warning seemed superfluous, as no man
standing in the garden could have put his pipe in his mouth
without grazing either the fence or the house, but the owner of
the &lsquo;premises&rsquo; possibly wished to warn the visitor at
the very threshold.</p>
<p>All the occupied houses in Eden Place were cheerful and
hospitable in their appearance, and were marked by an air of
liveliness and good-fellowship.&nbsp; Bed linen hung freely from
all the windows, for there was no hard and fast law about making
up beds at any special hour, though a remnant of superstition
still existed that it was a good thing to make up a bed before
you slept in it.&nbsp; There were more women on their respective
front steps, and fewer in their respective kitchens, in Eden
Place than in almost any other locality in the city.&nbsp; That
they lived for the most part in close and friendly relations
could be seen from the condition of the fences between the front
yards, whose upper rails fairly sagged with the weight of
gossip.</p>
<p>One woman, living in the middle of the row, evidently
possessed somewhat different views, for she had planted vines on
each of her division fences, rented her parlour to a lodger who
only slept there, kept all her front curtains drawn, and stayed
in the hack of her house.&nbsp; Such retribution as could legally
be wreaked upon this offensive and exclusive person was daily
administered by her two neighbours, who stood in their doors on
either side and conversed across her house and garden with much
freedom and exuberance.&nbsp; They had begged the landlord to
induce her to take up her abode elsewhere; but as she was the
only tenant who paid her rent regularly, he refused to part with
her.</p>
<p>Any one passing the &lsquo;No Smoking&rsquo; sign and entering
the front door of Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s house, on the corner, would
have turned off the narrow uncarpeted hall into the principal
room, and, if he were an observing person, would have been
somewhat puzzled by its appearance.&nbsp; There were seven or
eight long benches on one side, yet it had not the slightest
resemblance to a schoolroom.&nbsp; The walls were adorned with a
variety of interesting objects.&nbsp; There was a chart showing a
mammoth human hand, the palm marked with myriads of purple
lines.&nbsp; There were two others displaying respectively the
interior of the human being in the pink-and-white purity of total
abstinence, and the same interior after years of intemperance had
done their fatal work; a most valuable chart this last, and one
that had quenched the thirst of many a man.</p>
<p>The words &lsquo;<i>Poverty Must Go</i>&rsquo; were wrought in
evergreen letters over the bay window, and various texts were
printed in red and black and tacked to the wall in prominent
places.&nbsp; These were such as&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>To be a Flesh-Eater is to be a Shedder of Blood and
a Destroyer of God&rsquo;s Innocent Creatures</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Now that Man has Begun to Ascend in the Scale of
Being</i>, <i>let Woman Reach Down a Strong</i>, <i>Tender Hand
and Aid him in his Struggle for Moral and Spiritual
Elevation</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Let the Pleasure Field be as Large as
Possible</i>.&nbsp; <i>Pains and Fears Lessen
Growth</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I Believe that to Burden</i>, <i>to Bond</i>, <i>to
Tax</i>, <i>to Tribute</i>, <i>to Impoverish</i>, <i>to
Grind</i>, <i>to Pillage</i>, <i>to Oppress</i>, <i>to
Afflict</i>, <i>to Plunder</i>, <i>to Vampire the Life Labouring
to Create Wealth is the Unpardonable Sin</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Over the mantel-shelf was a seaweed picture in a frame of
shells, bearing the inscription, &lsquo;<i>Unity Hall</i>,
<i>Meeting-Place of the Order of Present
Perfection</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; On a table, waiting to be hung in
place, was an impressive sort of map about four feet
square.&nbsp; This, like many of the other ornaments in the room,
was a trifle puzzling, and seemed at first, from its plenitude of
coloured spots, to be some species of moral propaganda in a state
of violent eruption.&nbsp; It proved, however, on closer study,
to be an ingenious pictorial representation of the fifty largest
cities of the world, with the successful establishment of various
regenerating ideas indicated by coloured discs of paper neatly
pasted on the surface.&nbsp; The key in the right-hand corner

<p>A small gold star, added to the coloured spot, hovering over
the name of a city, was explained, in the lower left-hand corner,
as denoting the fact that the Eldorado face-powder was
exclusively used there, and that S. Cora Grubb was the sole agent
for the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>Joseph&rsquo;s coat faded into insignificance in comparison
with the city of Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s present residence, which
appeared to be a perfect hot-bed of world-saving ideas, and was
surrounded by such a halo of spots that it would have struck the
unregenerate observer as an undesirable place in which to live,
unless one wished to be broken daily on the rack of social
progress.</p>
<p>This front room was Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s only parlour.&nbsp; The
seven benches were rather in the way and seemingly unnecessary,
as the lady attended meetings morning, noon, and night in halls
hired for that purpose; but they gave her a feeling of security,
as, in case one of her less flourishing societies should be
ejected from its hall, or in case she should wake up in the
middle of the night and want to hold a meeting of any club when
all the halls were closed, the benches in the parlour would make
it possible without a moment&rsquo;s loss of time.</p>
<p>The room connecting with this was the family banquet-hall and
kitchen in one, and as Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s opinions on diet were
extremely advanced, it amply served the purpose.</p>
<p>There were three bedrooms upstairs, and the whole
establishment was rather untidy in its aspect; but, though it
might have been much cleaner, it is only fair to say that it
might also have been much dirtier.</p>
<p>The house was deserted.&nbsp; The only sound came from the
back yard, and it was the echo of children&rsquo;s voices.&nbsp;
It was not at all a merry prattle; it was a steady uproar
interrupted by occasional shrieks and yells, a clatter of falling
blocks, beatings of a tin pan, a scramble of feet, a tussle, with
confusion of blows and thumps, and then generally a temporary
lull in the proceedings, evidently brought about by some sort of
outside interference.&nbsp; If you had pushed open the wire door,
you would have seen two children of four or five years disporting
themselves in a sand-heap.&nbsp; One was a boy and one a girl;
and though they were not at all alike in feature or complexion,
there was an astonishing resemblance between them in size, in
figure, in voice, in expression, and, apparently, in
disposition.</p>
<p>Sitting on a bench, watching them as a dog watches its
master&rsquo;s coat, was a girl of some undeterminable
age,&mdash;perhaps of ten or twelve years.&nbsp; She wore a
shapeless stout gingham garment, her shoes were many sizes too
large for her, and the laces were dangling.&nbsp; Her nerveless
hands and long arms sprawled in her lap as if they had no
volition in them.&nbsp; She sat with her head slightly drooping,
her knees apart, and her feet aimlessly turned in.&nbsp; Her
lower lip hung a little, but only a little, loosely.&nbsp; She
looked neither at earth nor at sky, but straight at the two
belligerents, with whose bloodthirsty play she was obliged to
interfere at intervals.&nbsp; She held in her lap a doll made of
a roll of brown paper, with a waist and a neck indicated by
gingham strings.&nbsp; Pieces of ravelled rope were pinned on the
head part, but there was no other attempt to assist the
imagination.&nbsp; She raised her dull eyes; they seemed to hold
in their depths a knowledge of aloofness from the happier world,
and their dumb sorrow pierced your very heart, while it gave you
an irresistible sense of aversion.&nbsp; She smiled, but the
smile only gave you a new thrill; it was vacant and had no joy in
it, rather an uncommunicable grief.&nbsp; As she sat there with
her battered doll, she was to the superficial eye repulsive, but
to the eye that pierces externals she was almost majestic in her
mysterious loneliness and separation.</p>
<p>The steam-whistle of a factory near by blew a long note for
twelve o&rsquo;clock, and she rose from her bench, took the
children by the hand, and dragged them, kindly but firmly, up the
steps into the kitchen.&nbsp; She laid her doll under a towel,
but, with a furtive look at the boy, rolled it in a cloth and
tucked it under her skirt at the waist-line.&nbsp; She then
washed the children&rsquo;s faces, tied on their calico bibs, and
pushed them up to the pine table.&nbsp; While they battered the
board and each other with spoons and tin mugs, she went
automatically to a closet, took a dish of cold porridge and
turned it into three bowls, poured milk over it, spread three
thick slices of wheat bread with molasses from a cup, and sat
down at the table.&nbsp; After the simple repast was over, she
led the still reluctant (constitutionally reluctant) twins up the
staircase and put them, shrieking, on a bed; left the room,
locking the door behind her in a perfunctory sort of way as if it
were an everyday occurrence, crouched down on the rug outside,
and, leaning her head back against the wall, took her doll from
under her skirt, for this was her playtime, her hour of ease.</p>
<p>Poor little &lsquo;Marm Lisa,&rsquo; as the neighbours called
her!&nbsp; She had all the sorrows and cares of maternity with
none of its compensating joys.</p>

MISTRESS MARY&rsquo;S GARDEN</h3>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Mistress Mary, quite contrary,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How does your garden grow?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;With silver bells and cockle shells,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And little maids all in a row.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Mary&rsquo;s</span> Garden did
grow remarkably well, and it was wonderfully attractive
considering the fact that few persons besides herself saw
anything but weeds in it.</p>
<p>She did not look in the least a &lsquo;contrary&rsquo; Miss
Mary, as she stood on a certain flight of broad wooden steps on a
sunshiny morning; yet she was undoubtedly having her own way and
living her own life in spite of remonstrances from bevies of
friends, who saw no shadow of reason or common-sense in her sort
of gardening.&nbsp; It would have been foolish enough for a young
woman with a small living income to cultivate roses or violets or
lavender, but this would at least have been poetic, while the
arduous tilling of a soil where the only plants were little
people &lsquo;all in a row&rsquo; was something beyond
credence.</p>
<p>The truth about Mistress Mary lay somewhere in the <i>via
media</i> between the criticisms of her sceptical friends and the
encomiums of her enthusiastic admirers.&nbsp; In forsaking
society temporarily she had no rooted determination to forsake it
eternally, and if the incense of love which her neophytes for
ever burned at her shrine savoured somewhat of adoration, she
disarmed jealousy by frankly avowing her unworthiness and lack of
desire to wear the martyr&rsquo;s crown.&nbsp; Her happiness in
her chosen vocation made it impossible, she argued, to regard her
as a person worthy of canonisation; though the neophytes were
always sighing to</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;have
that little head of hers<br />
Painted upon a background of pale gold.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She had been born with a capacity for helping lame dogs over
stiles; accordingly, her pathway, from a very early age, had been
bestrewn with stiles, and processions of lame dogs ever limping
towards them.&nbsp; Her vocation had called her so imperiously
that disobedience was impossible.&nbsp; It is all very well if a
certain work asks one in a quiet and courteous manner to come and
do it, when one has time and inclination; but it is quite another
matter if it coaxes one so insistently that one can do nothing
else properly, and so succumbs finally to the persuasive
voice.&nbsp; Still, the world must be mothered somehow, and there
are plenty of women who lack the time or the strength, the gift
or the desire, the love or the patience, to do their share.&nbsp;
This gap seems to be filled now and then by some inspired little
creature like Mistress Mary, with enough potential maternity to
mother an orphan asylum; too busy, too absorbed, too radiantly
absent-minded to see a husband in any man, but claiming every
child in the universe as her very own.&nbsp; There was never
anywhere an urchin so dirty, so ragged, so naughty, that it could
not climb into Mistress Mary&rsquo;s lap, and from thence into
her heart.&nbsp; The neophytes partook of her zeal in greater or
less degree, and, forsaking all probability of lovers (though
every one of them was young and pretty), they tied on their white
aprons and clave only unto her.&nbsp; Daily intercourse with a
couple of hundred little street Arabs furnished a field for the
practice of considerable feminine virtue, and in reality the
woman&rsquo;s kingdom at the top of the broad wooden steps was a
great &lsquo;culture engine&rsquo; of spiritual motherhood.</p>
<p>It certainly was a very merry place, and if its presiding
geniuses were engaged in conscious philanthropy, the blighting
hallmark was conspicuous by its absence.&nbsp; Peals of laughter
rang through the rooms; smiling faces leaned from the upstairs
windows, bowing greeting to the ashman, the scissors-grinder, the
Italian and Chinese vegetable-vendors, the rag-sack-and-bottle
man, and the other familiar figures of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>It was at the end of a happy, helpful day that Mistress Mary
stood in the front door and looked out over her kingdom.</p>
<p>There was a rosy Swedish girl sitting on the floor of a shop
window opposite and washing the glass.&nbsp; She had moved the
fresh vegetables aside and planted herself in the midst of
them.&nbsp; There she sat among the cabbages and turnips and
other sweet things just out of the earth; piles of delicate green
lettuce buds, golden carrots bursting into feathery tops, ruddy
beets, and pink-checked.&nbsp; It was pretty to see the honest
joy of her work and the interest of her parted lips, when, after
polishing the glass, it shone as crystal clear as her own
eyes.&nbsp; A milkman stopping to look at her (and small wonder
that he did) poured nearly a quart of cream on the ground, and
two children ran squabbling under the cart to see if they could
catch the drippings in their mouths.&nbsp; They were Atlantic and
Pacific Simonson with Marm Lisa, as usual, at their heels.&nbsp;
She had found her way to this corner twice of late, because
things happened there marvellous enough to stir even her heavy
mind.&nbsp; There was a certain flight of narrow, rickety steps
leading to a rickety shanty, and an adjacent piece of fence with
a broad board on top.&nbsp; Flower-pots had once stood there, but
they were now lying on the ground below, broken into
fragments.&nbsp; Marm Lisa could push the twins up to this
vantage-ground, and crawl up after them.&nbsp; Once ensconced, if
they had chosen the right time of day, interesting events were
sure to be forthcoming.&nbsp; In a large playground within range
of vision, there were small children, as many in number as the
sands of the seashore.&nbsp; At a given moment, a lovely angel
with black hair and a scarlet apron would ring a large
bell.&nbsp; Simultaneously, a lovely angel with brown hair and a
white apron would fly to the spot, and the children would go
through a mysterious process like the swarming of bees around a
queen.&nbsp; Slowly, reluctantly, painfully, the swarm settled
itself into lines in conformance with some hidden law or
principle unknown to Marm Lisa.&nbsp; Then, when comparative
order had been evolved from total chaos, the most beautiful angel
of all would appear in a window; and the reason she always struck
the onlookers as a being of beauty and majesty was partly,
perhaps, because her head seemed to rise from a cloud of white
(which was in reality only a fichu of white mull), and partly
because she always wore a slender fillet of steel to keep back
the waves of her fair hair.&nbsp; It had a little point in front,
and when the sun shone on its delicate, fine-cut prisms it
glittered like a halo.&nbsp; After the appearance of this
heavenly apparition the endless lines of little people wended
their was into the building, and enchanting strains of music were
wafted through the open windows, supplemented sometimes by the
inspiring rattle of drums and the blare of instruments hitherto
indissolubly associated with street parades.</p>
<p>Who?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Whence?&nbsp; Whither?&nbsp; What
for?&nbsp; These were some of the questions that assailed Marm
Lisa&rsquo;s mind, but in so incoherent a form that she left
them, with all other questions, unanswered.&nbsp; Atlantic and
Pacific were curious, too, but other passions held greater sway
with them; for when the children disappeared and the music
ceased, they called loudly for more, and usually scratched and
pinched Marm Lisa as they were lifted down from the fence; not
seeing daily how anybody else could be held answerable for the
cessation of the entertainment, and scratches and pinches being
the only remedial agencies that suggested themselves.</p>
<p>On this particular occasion there were no bells, no music, and
no mysterious swarming; but the heavenly apparition sat on the
broad steps.&nbsp; Yes, it was she!&nbsp; Blue-grey eyes with
darker lashes sweeping the warm ivory of her cheeks, sweet true
lips for ever parting in kind words, the white surplice and
apron, and the rememberable steel fillet.&nbsp; She had a little
child in her lap (she generally had, by the way), and there were
other tots clinging fondly to her motherly skirts.&nbsp; Marm
Lisa stood at the foot of the steps, a twin glued to each
side.&nbsp; She stared at Mistress Mary with open-mouthed wonder
not unmixed with admiration.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That same odd child,&rsquo; thought Mary.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have seen her before, and always with those two little
vampires hanging to her skirts.&nbsp; She looks a trifle young to
have such constant family cares; perhaps we had better
&ldquo;lend a hand.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rsquo; she asked, with a smile
that would have drawn a sane person up the side of a
precipice.</p>
<p>Atlantic turned and ran, but the other two stood their
ground.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you come up and see us?&rsquo; she
repeated.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are some fishes swimming in a glass
house; come and look at them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marm Lisa felt herself dragged up the steps as by invisible
chains, and even Pacific did not attempt to resist the
irresistible.&nbsp; Atlantic, finding himself deserted by his
comrades, gave a yell of baffled rage, and scrambled up the steps
after them.&nbsp; But his tears dried instantly at the sight of
the room into which they were ushered; as large as any of the
halls in which Aunt Cora spent her days, and how much more
beautiful!&nbsp; They roved about, staring at the aquarium, and
gazing at the rocking-horse, the piano, the drum, the hanging
gardens, with speechless astonishment.&nbsp; Lisa shambled at
their heels, looking at nothing very long; and when Rhoda (one of
the neophytes), full of sympathy at the appearance of the wild,
forlorn, unkempt trio, sat herself down on a sofa and gathered
them about a wonderful picture-book, Mistress Mary&rsquo;s keen
eyes saw that Lisa&rsquo;s gaze wandered in a few minutes.&nbsp;
Presently she crept over the floor towards a table, and, taking a
string from it, began to blow it to and fro as it hung from her
fingers.&nbsp; Rhoda&rsquo;s glance followed Mary&rsquo;s; but it
was only a fleeting one, for the four eyes of the twins were
riveted on hers with devouring eagerness, while they waited for
her explanation of the pictures.&nbsp; At the end of half an
hour, in which the children had said little or nothing, they had
contrived to reveal so many sorrowful and startling details of
their mental, moral, and physical endowment, that Mistress Mary
put on her hat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will go home with them,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is plenty of work here for somebody; I could almost
hope that it won&rsquo;t prove ours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will,&rsquo; replied Rhoda, with a stifled
sigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is an old Eastern legend about the black
camel that comes and lies down before the door of him upon whom
Heaven is going to lay her chastening hand.&nbsp; Every time I
have seen that awful trio on the fence-top, they were fairly
surrounded by black camels in my imagination.&nbsp; Mistress
Mary, I am not sure but that, in self-defence, we ought to become
a highly specialised <i>Something</i>.&nbsp; We are now a home, a
mother, a nursery, a labour bureau, a divorce court, a registry
of appeals, a soup kitchen, an advisory hoard, and a police
force.&nbsp; If we take <i>her</i>, what shall we be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will see first where she belongs,&rsquo; smiled
Mary.&nbsp; (Nobody could help smiling at Rhoda.)&nbsp;
&lsquo;Somebody has been neglecting his or her duty.&nbsp; If we
can make that somebody realise his delinquencies, all the better,
for the responsibility will not be ours.&nbsp; If we cannot, why,
the case is clear enough and simple enough in my mind.&nbsp; We
certainly do not want &ldquo;<i>Mene</i>, <i>mene</i>,
<i>tekel</i>, <i>upharsin</i>&rdquo; written over this, of all
doors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda&rsquo;s hand went up to an imaginary cap in a gesture of
military obedience.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well, my general.&nbsp; I
fly to prepare weapons with which to fight Satan.&nbsp; You, of
course, will take <i>her</i>; oh, my dear, I&rsquo;m almost
afraid you oughtn&rsquo;t!&nbsp; I choose the bullet-headed
blonde twin who says his name is &ldquo;Lanty,&rdquo; and reserve
for Edith the bursting-with-fat brunette twin who calls herself
&ldquo;Ciffy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Edith&rsquo;s disciplinary powers have
been too much vaunted of late; we shall see if Ciffy ruffles her
splendid serenity.&rsquo;</p>

A FAMILY POLYGON</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s</span> family circle
was really not a circle at all; it was rather a polygon&mdash;a
curious assemblage of distinct personages.</p>
<p>There was no unity in it, no membership one of another.&nbsp;
It was four ones, not one four.&nbsp; If some gatherer of
statistics had visited the household, he might have described it
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>Mrs. S. Cora Grubb, widow, aged forty years.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alisa Bennett, feeble-minded, aged ten or twelve
years.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Atlantic and Pacific Simonson, twins, aged four
years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The man of statistics might seek in vain for some principle of
attraction or cohesion between these independent elements; but no
one who knew Mrs. Grubb would have been astonished at the sort of
family that had gathered itself about her.&nbsp; Queer as it
undoubtedly was at this period, it had, at various times, been
infinitely queerer.&nbsp; There was a certain memorable month,
shortly after her husband&rsquo;s decease, when Mrs. Grubb
allowed herself to be considered as a compensated hostess, though
the terms &lsquo;landlady&rsquo; and &lsquo;boarder&rsquo; were
never uttered in her hearing.&nbsp; She hired a Chinese cook, who
slept at home; cleared out, for the use of Lisa and the twins, a
small storeroom in which she commonly kept Eldorado face-powder;
and herself occupied a sofa in the apartment of a friend of
humanity in the next street.&nbsp; These arrangements enabled her
to admit an experimenter on hypnotism, a mental healer who had
been much abused by the orthodox members of her cult, and was
evolving a method of her own, an ostensible delegate to an
Occidental Conference of Religions, and a lady agent for a
flexible celluloid undershirt.&nbsp; For a few days Mrs. Grubb
found the society of these persons very stimulating and
agreeable; but before long the hypnotist proved to be an
unscrupulous gentleman, who hypnotised the mental healer so that
she could not heal, and the Chinese cook so that he could not
cook.&nbsp; When, therefore, the delegate departed suddenly in
company with the celluloid-underwear lady, explaining by a
hurried postal card that they would &lsquo;remit&rsquo; from
Chicago, she evicted the other two boarders, and retired again to
private life.</p>
<p>This episode was only one of Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s many
divagations, for she had been a person of advanced ideas from a
comparatively early age.&nbsp; It would seem that she must have
inherited a certain number of &lsquo;views,&rsquo; because no
human being could have amassed, in a quarter of a century, as
many as she held at the age of twenty-five.&nbsp; She had then
stood up with Mr. Charles Grubb, before a large assembly, in the
presence of which they promised to assume and continue the
relation of husband and wife so long as it was mutually
agreeable.&nbsp; As a matter of fact it had not been mutually
agreeable to Mr. Grubb more than six months, but such was the
nobility of his character that he never disclosed his
disappointment nor claimed any immunity from the responsibilities
of the marriage state.&nbsp; Mr. Grubb was a timid, conventional
soul, who would have given all the testimony of all the witnesses
of his wedding ceremony for the mere presence of a single parson;
but he imagined himself in love with Cora Wilkins, and she could
neither be wooed nor won by any of the beaten paths that led to
other women.&nbsp; He foolishly thought that the number of her
convictions would grow less after she became a wife, little
suspecting the fertility of her mind, which put forth a new
explanation of the universe every day, like a strawberry plant
that devotes itself so exclusively to &lsquo;runners&rsquo; that
it has little vigour left for producing fruit.</p>
<p>The town in New York where they lived proving to be too small,
narrow, and bigoted to hold a developing soul like Mrs.
Grubb&rsquo;s, she persuaded her husband to take passage for
California, where the climate might be supposed more favourable
to the growth of saving ideas.&nbsp; Mr. Grubb would, of course,
be obliged to relinquish his business, but people could buy and
sell anywhere, she thought, and as for her, she wanted nothing
but unlimited space in which to expand.</p>
<p>There was money enough for an economical journey and a month
or two of idleness afterwards; and as Mrs. Grubb believed
everything in the universe was hers, if she only chose to claim
it, the question of finances never greatly troubled her.&nbsp;
They sailed for the golden West, then, this ill-assorted couple,
accompanied by Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s only sister, who had been a
wife, was now a widow, and would shortly become a mother.&nbsp;
The interesting event occurred much sooner than had been
anticipated.&nbsp; The ship became the birthplace of the twins,
who had been most unwelcome when they were thought about as one,
and entirely offensive when found to be two.&nbsp; The mother did
not long survive the shock of her surprise and displeasure, and
after naming the babies Atlantic and Pacific, and confiding them
distinctly to the care of Mr., not Mrs., Grubb, she died, and was
buried at sea, not far from Cape Horn.&nbsp; Mrs. Cora enjoyed at
first the dramatic possibilities of her position on the ship,
where the baby orphans found more than one kindly, sentimental
woman ready to care for them; but there was no permanent place in
her philosophy for a pair of twins who entered existence with a
concerted shriek, and continued it for ever afterwards, as if
their only purpose in life was to keep the lungs well
inflated.&nbsp; Her supreme wish was to be freed from the carking
cares of the flesh, and thus for ever ready to wing her free
spirit in the pure ether of speculation.</p>
<p>You would hardly suppose that the obscure spouse of Mrs. Grubb
could wash and dress the twins, prepare their breakfast, go to
his work, come home and put them to bed, four or five days out of
every seven in the week; but that is what he did, accepting it as
one phase of the mysterious human comedy (or was it tragedy?) in
which he played his humble part.</p>
<p>Mrs. Grubb was no home spirit, no goddess of the hearth.&nbsp;
She graced her family board when no invitation to refresh herself
elsewhere had been proffered, and that she generally slept in her
own bed is as strong a phrase as can be written on the
subject.&nbsp; If she had been born in Paris, at the proper time,
she would have been the leader of a salon; separated from that
brilliant destiny by years, by race, and by imperious
circumstance, she wielded the same sort of sceptre in her own
circumscribed but appreciative sphere.&nbsp; No social occasion
in Eden Place was complete without Mrs. Grubb.&nbsp; With her
(and some light refreshment), a party lacked nothing; without
her, even if other conditions were favourable, it seemed a flat,
stale, and unprofitable affair.&nbsp; Like Robin Adair,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;She made the ball so fine;<br />
She made th&rsquo; occasion shine.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Grubb hanging on her front gate, duster in hand (she
never conversed quite as well without it, and never did anything
else with it), might have been a humble American descendant of
Madame de Sta&euml;l talking on the terrace at Coppet, with the
famous sprig of olive in her fingers.&nbsp; She moved among her
subjects like a barouche among express wagons, was heard after
them as a song after sermons.&nbsp; That she did not fulfil the
whole duty of woman did not occur to her fascinated
constituents.&nbsp; There was always some duller spirit who could
slip in and &lsquo;do the dishes,&rsquo; that Mrs. Grubb might
grace a <i>conversazione</i> on the steps or at the gate.&nbsp;
She was not one of those napkin people who hide their talents, or
who immure their lights under superincumbent bushels.&nbsp;
Whatever was hers was everybody&rsquo;s, for she dispensed her
favours with a liberal hand.&nbsp; She would never have permitted
a child to suffer for lack of food or bed, for she was not at
heart an unkind woman.&nbsp; You could see that by looking at her
vague, soft brown eyes,&mdash;eyes that never saw practical
duties straight in front of them,&mdash;liquid, star-gazing,
vision-seeing eyes, that could never be focussed on any near
object, such as a twin or a cooking-stove.&nbsp; Individuals
never interested her; she cared for nothing but humanity, and
humanity writ very large at that, so that once the twins nearly
died of scarlatina while Mrs. Grubb was collecting money for the
children of the yellow-fever sufferers in the South.</p>
<p>But Providence had an eye for Mr. Grubb&rsquo;s
perplexities.&nbsp; It does not and cannot always happen, in a
world like this, that vice is assisted to shirk, and virtue
aideth to do, its duty; but any man as marvellously afflicted as
Mr. Grubb is likely to receive not only spiritual consolation,
but miraculous aid of some sort.&nbsp; The spectacle of the
worthy creature as he gave the reluctant twins their occasional
bath, and fed them on food regularly prescribed by Mrs. Grubb,
and almost as regularly rejected by them, would have melted the
stoniest heart.&nbsp; And who was the angel of deliverance?&nbsp;
A little vacant-eyed, half-foolish, almost inarticulate child,
whose feeble and sickly mother was dragging out a death-in-life
existence in a street near by.&nbsp; The child saw Mr. Grubb
wheeling the twins in a double perambulator: followed them home;
came again, and then again, and then again; hung about the door,
fell upon a dog that threatened to bite them, and drove it away
howling; often stood over the perambulator with a sunshade for
three hours at a time, without moving a muscle; and adored Mr.
Grubb with a consuming passion.&nbsp; There was no special reason
for this sentiment, but then Alisa Bennett was not quite a
reasonable being.&nbsp; Mr. Grubb had never been adored before in
his life; and to say the truth, his personality was not
winning.&nbsp; He had a pink, bald head, pale blue eyes, with
blond tufts for eyebrows, and a pointed beard dripping from his
chin, which tended to make him look rather like an invalid
goat.&nbsp; But as animals are said to have an eye for spirits,
children have an eye for souls, which is far rarer than an eye
for beautiful surfaces.</p>
<p>Mr. Grubb began by loathing Alisa, then patiently suffered
her, then pitied, then respected, then loved her.&nbsp; Mrs.
Grubb seldom saw her, and objected to nothing by which she
herself was relieved of care.&nbsp; So Lisa grew to be first a
familiar figure in the household, and later an indispensable
one.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs. Bennett finally came to the end of things
temporal.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dying is the first piece of good luck I
ever had,&rsquo; she said to Mr. Grubb.&nbsp; &lsquo;If it turns
out that I&rsquo;ve brought a curse upon an innocent creature,
I&rsquo;d rather go and meet my punishment half-way than stay
here and see it worked out to the end.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;In my Father&rsquo;s house are many
mansions,&rdquo;&rsquo; stammered Mr. Grubb, who had never before
administered spiritual consolation.</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I can only get rid of this
world, it&rsquo;s all I ask,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;if the other
one isn&rsquo;t any better, why, it can&rsquo;t be any
worse!&nbsp; Feel under the mattress and you&rsquo;ll find money
enough to last three or four years.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all
she&rsquo;ll ever get, for she hasn&rsquo;t a soul now to look to
for help.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way we human beings arrange
things,&mdash;we, or the Lord, or the Evil One, or whoever it is;
we bring a puzzle into the world, and then leave it for other
people to work out&mdash;if they can!&nbsp; Who&rsquo;ll work out
this one?&nbsp; Who&rsquo;ll work out this one?&nbsp; Perhaps
she&rsquo;ll die before the money&rsquo;s gone; let&rsquo;s hope
for the best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t take on like that!&rsquo; said Mr. Grubb
despairingly,&mdash;&lsquo;don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Pray for
resignation, can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray!&rsquo; she exclaimed scornfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thank goodness, I&rsquo;ve got enough self-respect left
not to pray!&mdash;Yes, I must pray, I <i>must</i> . . . Oh,
God!&nbsp; I do not ask forgiveness for him or for myself; I only
beg that, in some way I cannot see, we may be punished, and she
spared!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And when the stricken soul had fled from her frail body, they
who came to prepare her for the grave looked at her face and
found it shining with hope.</p>
<p>It was thus that poor little Alisa Bennett assumed maternal
responsibilities at the age of ten, and gained her sobriquet of
&lsquo;Marm Lisa.&rsquo;&nbsp; She grew more human, more
tractable, under Mr. Grubb&rsquo;s fostering care; but that
blessed martyr had now been dead two years, and she began to wear
her former vacuous look, and to slip back into the past that was
still more dreadful than the present.</p>
<p>It seemed to Mrs. Grubb more than strange that she, with her
desire for freedom, should be held to earth by three children not
flesh of her flesh&mdash;and such children.&nbsp; The father of
the twins had been a professional pugilist, but even that fact
could never sufficiently account for Pacific Simonson.&nbsp; She
had apparently inherited instincts from tribes of warlike
ancestors who skulked behind trees with battle-axes, and no one
except her superior in size and courage was safe from her violent
hand.&nbsp; She had little, wicked, dark eyes and crimson,
swollen cheeks, while Atlantic had flaxen hair, a low forehead,
and a square jaw.&nbsp; He had not Pacific&rsquo;s ingenuity in
conceiving evil; but when it was once conceived, he had a dogged
persistency in carrying it out that made him worthy of his
twin.</p>
<p>Yet with all these crosses Mrs. Grubb was moderately cheerful,
for her troubles were as nebulous as everything else to her
mind.&nbsp; She intended to invent some feasible plan for her
deliverance sooner or later, but she was much more intent upon
development than deliverance, and she never seemed to have the
leisure to break her shackles.&nbsp; Nothing really mattered
much.&nbsp; Her body might be occasionally in Eden Place, but her
soul was always in a hired hall.&nbsp; She delighted in joining
the New Order of Something,&mdash;anything, so long as it was an
Order and a new one,&mdash;and then going with a selected
committee to secure a lodge-room or a hall for meetings.&nbsp;
She liked to walk up the dim aisle with the janitor following
after her, and imagine brilliant lights (paid for by collection),
a neat table and lamp and pitcher of iced water, and herself in
the chair as president or vice-president, secretary or humble
trustee.&nbsp; There was that about her that precluded the
possibility of simple membership.&nbsp; She always rose into
office the week after she had joined any society.&nbsp; If there
was no office vacant, then some bold spirit (generally male)
would create one, that Mrs. Grubb might not wither in the privacy
of the ranks.&nbsp; Before the charter members had fully learned
the alphabet of their order and had gained a thorough
understanding of the social revolution it was destined to work,
Mrs. Grubb had mastered the whole scheme and was unfolding it
before large classes for the study of the higher theory.&nbsp;
The instant she had a tale to tell she presumed the
&lsquo;listening earth&rsquo; to be ready to hear it.&nbsp; The
new Order became an old one in course of time, and, like the
nautilus.&nbsp; Mrs. Grubb outgrew her shell and built herself a
more stately chamber.&nbsp; Another clue to the universe was soon
forthcoming, for all this happened in a city where it is
necessary only for a man to open his lips and say, &lsquo;I am a
prophet&rsquo;, and followers flock unto him as many in number as
the stars.&nbsp; She was never disturbed that the last clue had
brought her nowhere; she followed the new one as passionately as
the old, and told her breathless pupils that their feet must not
be weary, for they were treading the path of progress; that these
apparently fruitless excursions into the domain of knowledge all
served as so many milestones in their glorious ascent of the
mountain of truth.</p>

/>
MARM LISA IS TRANSPLANTED</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was precisely as Rhoda thought
and feared.&nbsp; The three strange beings who had drifted within
Mistress Mary&rsquo;s reach had proved to belong to her simply
because they did not belong to anybody else.&nbsp; They did not
know their names, the streets in which they lived, or anything
else about which they were questioned, but she had followed them
home to the corner house of Eden Place, although she failed, on
the occasion of that first visit, to find Mrs. Grubb
within.&nbsp; There was, however, a very voluble person next
door, who supplied a little information and asked considerable
more.&nbsp; Mrs. Sylvester told Mary that Mrs. Grubb was at that
moment presiding over a meeting of the Kipling Brothers in Unity
Hall, just round the corner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They meet Tuesdays and Thursdays at four
o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and you&rsquo;d find it a
real treat if you like to step over there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, I am rather busy this afternoon,&rsquo;
replied Mary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you wish to leave any name or message?&nbsp; Did you
want a setting?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A sitting?&rsquo; asked Mary vaguely.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh
no, thank you; I merely wished to see Mrs. Grubb&mdash;is that
the name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it, and an awful grievance it is to
her&mdash;Mrs. S. Cora Grubb.&nbsp; You have seen it in the
newspapers, I suppose; she has a half column &ldquo;ad.&rdquo; in
the <i>Sunday Observer</i> once a month.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t you
like your nails attended to?&nbsp; I have a perfectly splendid
manicure stopping with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you.&nbsp; I hoped to see Mrs. Grubb, to ask
if her children can come and spend the morning with me
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;ll be all right; they&rsquo;re not her
children; she doesn&rsquo;t care where they go; they stay in the
back yard or on the sand-lot most of the time: she&rsquo;s got
something more important to occupy her attention.&nbsp; Say, I
hope you&rsquo;ll excuse me, but you look a little pale.&nbsp; If
you were intending to get some mental healing from Mrs. Grubb,
why, I can do it; she found I had the power, and she&rsquo;s
handed all her healing over to me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a new method,
and is going to supersede all the others, we think.&nbsp; My
hours are from ten to twelve, and two to four, but I could take
you evenings, if you&rsquo;re occupied during the day.&nbsp; My
cures are almost as satisfactory as Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s now,
though I haven&rsquo;t been healing but six months last
Wednesday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fortunately I am very well and strong,&rsquo; smiled
Mistress Mary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all right, but you don&rsquo;t know
how soon sickness may overtake you, if you haven&rsquo;t learned
to cast off fear and practise the denials.&nbsp; Those who are
living in error are certain to be affected by it sooner or later,
unless they accept the new belief.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you have
your nails done, now you&rsquo;re here?&nbsp; My manicure has the
highest kind of a polish,&mdash;she uses pumice powder and the
rose of Peru lustre; you ought to try her; by taking twenty
tickets you get your single treatments for thirty-five cents
apiece.&nbsp; Not this afternoon?&nbsp; Well, some other time,
then.&nbsp; It will be all right about the children and very good
of you to want them.&nbsp; Of course you can&rsquo;t teach them
anything, if that&rsquo;s your idea.&nbsp; Belief in original sin
is all against my theories, but I confess I can&rsquo;t explain
the twins without it.&nbsp; I sometimes wonder I can do any
healing with them in the next house throwing off evil
influences.&nbsp; I am treating Lisa by suggestion, but she
hasn&rsquo;t responded any yet.&nbsp; Call again, won&rsquo;t
you?&nbsp; Mrs. Grubb is in from seven to eight in the morning,
and ten-thirty to eleven-thirty in the evening.&nbsp; You ought
to know her; we think there&rsquo;s nobody like Mrs. Grubb; she
has a wonderful following, and it&rsquo;s growing all the time; I
took this house to be near her.&nbsp; Good afternoon.&nbsp; By
the way, if you or any of your friends should require any vocal
culture, you couldn&rsquo;t do better than take of Madame
Goldmarker in No. 17.&nbsp; She can make anybody sing, they
say.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m taking of her right along, and my voice has
about doubled in size.&nbsp; I ought to be leading the Kipling
Brothers now, but my patients stayed so late to-day I
didn&rsquo;t get a good start.&nbsp; Good afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The weeks wore on, and the children were old friends when Mary
finally made Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s acquaintance; but in the somewhat
hurried interviews she had with that lady at first, she never
seemed able to establish the kind of relation she desired.&nbsp;
The very atmosphere of her house was chaotic, and its equally
chaotic mistress showed no sign of seeking advice on any
point.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marm Lisa could hardly be received in the
schools,&rsquo; Mary told the listening neophytes one afternoon
when they were all together.&nbsp; &lsquo;There ought of course
to be a special place for her and such as she, somewhere, and
people are beginning to see and feel the importance of it here;
but until the thought and hope become a reality the State will
simply put the child in with the idiots and lunatics, to grow
more and more wretched, more hopeless, more stupid, until the
poor little light is quenched in utter darkness.&nbsp; There is
hope for her now, I am sure of it.&nbsp; If Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s
neighbours have told me the truth, any physical malady that may
be pursuing her is in its very first stages; for, so far as they
know in Eden Place, where one doesn&rsquo;t look for exact
knowledge, to be sure, she has had but two or three attacks
(&ldquo;dizziness&rdquo; or &ldquo;faintness&rdquo; they called
them) in as many years.&nbsp; She was very strange and
intractable just before the last one, and much clearer in her
mind afterwards.&nbsp; They think her worse of late, and have
advised Mrs. Grubb to send her to an insane asylum if she
doesn&rsquo;t improve.&nbsp; She would probably have gone there
long ago if she had not been such a valuable watch-dog for the
twins; but she does not belong there,&mdash;we have learned that
from the doctors.&nbsp; They say decisively that she is curable,
but that she needs very delicate treatment.&nbsp; My opinion is
that we have a lovely bit of rescue-work sent directly into our
hands in the very nick of time.&nbsp; All those in favour of
opening the garden gates a little wider for Marm Lisa respond by
saying &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a shout from the neophytes that shook the very
rafters&mdash;such a shout that Lisa shuttled across the room,
and, sitting down on a stool at Mistress Mary&rsquo;s feet,
looked up at her with a dull, uncomprehending smile.&nbsp; Why
were those beloved eyes full of tears?&nbsp; She could not be
displeased, for she had been laughing a moment before.&nbsp; She
hardly knew why, but Mistress Mary&rsquo;s wet eyes tortured her;
she made an ejaculation of discomfort and resentment, and taking
the corner of her apron wiped her new friend&rsquo;s face softly,
gazing at her with a dumb sorrow until the smile came back; then
she took out her string and her doll and played by herself as
contentedly as usual.</p>
<p>It was thus that heaven began to dawn on poor Marm Lisa.&nbsp;
At first only a physical heaven: temporary separation from
Atlantic and Pacific; a chair to herself in a warm, sunshiny
room; beautiful, bright, incomprehensible things hanging on the
walls; a soft gingham apron that her clumsy fingers loved to
touch; brilliant bits of colour and entrancing waves of sound
that roused her sleeping senses to something like pleasure; a
smile meeting her eyes when she looked up&mdash;oh! she knew a
smile&mdash;God lets love dwell in these imprisoned
spirits!&nbsp; By-and-by all these new sensations were followed
by thoughts, or something akin to them.&nbsp; Her face wore a
brooding, puzzled look, &lsquo;Poor little soul, she is feeling
her growing-pains!&rsquo; said Mistress Mary.&nbsp; It was a mind
sitting in a dim twilight where everything seems confused.&nbsp;
The physical eye appears to see, but the light never quite
pierces the dimness nor reflects its beauty there.&nbsp; If the
ears hear the song of birds, the cooing of babes, the heart-beat
in the organ tone, then the swift little messengers that fly
hither and thither in my mind and yours, carrying echoes of
sweetness unspeakable, tread more slowly here, and never quite
reach the spirit in prison.&nbsp; A spirit in prison, indeed, but
with one ray of sunlight shining through the bars,&mdash;a vision
of duty.&nbsp; Lisa&rsquo;s weak memory had lost almost all trace
of Mr. Grubb as a person but the old instinct of fidelity was
still there in solution, and unconsciously influenced her
actions.&nbsp; The devotion that first possessed her when she
beheld the twins as babies in the perambulator still held sway
against all their evil actions.&nbsp; If they plunged into danger
she plunged after them without a thought of consequences.&nbsp;
There was, perhaps, no real heroism in this, for she saw no risks
and counted no cost: this is what other people said, but Mistress
Mary always thought Marm Lisa had in her the stuff out of which
heroes and martyrs are made.&nbsp; She had never walked in
life&rsquo;s sunny places; it had always been the valley of the
shadow for her.&nbsp; She was surrounded by puzzles with never
any answer to one of them, but if only she had comprehended the
truth, it was these very puzzles that were her salvation.&nbsp;
While her feeble mind stirred, while it wondered, brooded,
suffered,&mdash;enough it did all these too seldom,&mdash;it kept
itself alive, even if the life were only like the flickering of a
candle.&nbsp; And now the candle might flicker, but it should
never go out altogether, if half a dozen pairs of women&rsquo;s
hands could keep it from extinction; and how patiently they were
outstretched to shield the poor apology for a flame, and coax it
into burning more brightly!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let the child choose her own special teacher,&rsquo;
said Mistress Mary; &lsquo;she is sure to have a strong
preference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it will be you,&rsquo; laughed Helen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish; it may be any one of us and it
will prove nothing in any case, save a fancy that we can direct
to good use.&nbsp; She seldom looks at anybody but you,&rsquo;
said Edith.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is true,&rsquo; replied Mary thoughtfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I think she is attracted by this glittering steel thing in
my hair.&nbsp; I am going to weave it into Helen&rsquo;s curly
crop some day, and see whether she misses it or transfers her
affection.&nbsp; I have made up my mind who is the best teacher
for her, and whom she will chose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda gave a comical groan.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say
it&rsquo;s I,&rsquo; she pleaded.&nbsp; &lsquo;I dread it.&nbsp;
Please I am not good enough, I don&rsquo;t know how; and besides,
she gives me the creeps!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mistress Mary turned on Rhoda with a reproachful smile,
saying, &lsquo;You naughty Rhoda, with the brightest eyes, the
swiftest feet, the nimblest fingers, the lightest heart among us
all, why do you want to shirk?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mistress Mary had noted the fact that Lisa had refused to sit
in an unpainted chair, but had dragged a red one from another
room and ensconced herself in it, though it was uncomfortably
small.</p>
<p>Now Rhoda was well named, for she was a rose of a girl, with
damask cheeks that glowed like two Jacqueminot beauties.&nbsp;
She was much given to aprons of scarlet linen, to collars and
belts of red velvet, and she had a general air of being fresh,
thoroughly alive, and in a state of dewy and perennial
bloom.&nbsp; Mary was right in her surmise, and whenever she
herself was out of Lisa&rsquo;s sight or reach the child turned
to Rhoda instinctively and obeyed her implicitly.</p>

HOW THE NEW PLANT GREW</h2>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Now</span>, Rhoda dear,&rsquo; said
Mistress Mary one day, when Lisa had become somewhat wonted to
her new surroundings, &lsquo;you are to fold your hands
respectfully in your lap and I will teach you
things,&mdash;things which you in your youth and inexperience
have not thought about as yet.&nbsp; The other girls may listen,
too, and catch the drippings of my wisdom.&nbsp; I really know
little about the education of defective children, but, thank
heaven, I can put two and two together, as Susan Nipper
said.&nbsp; The general plan will be to train Lisa&rsquo;s hands
and speak to her senses in every possible way, since her organs
of sense are within your reach, and those of thought are out of
it.&nbsp; The hardest lesson for such a child to learn is the
subordination of its erratic will to our normal ones.&nbsp;
Lisa&rsquo;s attention is the most hopeful thing about her and
encourages me more than anything else.&nbsp; It is not as if
there were no mental processes existing; they are there, but in a
very enfeebled state.&nbsp; Of course she should have been under
skilled teaching the six years, but, late as it is, we
couldn&rsquo;t think of giving up a child who can talk, use her
right hand, dress herself, go upon errands, recognise colours,
wash dishes; who is apparently neither vicious nor cunning, but
who, on the contrary, has lived four years under the same roof
with Mrs. S. Cora Grubb without rebellion or violence or
treachery!&nbsp; Why, dear girls, such a task, if it did not
appeal to one on the moral, certainly would on the intellectual,
side.&nbsp; Marm Lisa will teach us more in a year, you may be
sure, than we shall teach her.&nbsp; Let us keep a record of our
experiments; drop all materials that seem neither to give her
sensations nor wake her discriminative power, and choose others
that speak to her more clearly.&nbsp; Let us watch her closely,
both to penetrate the secret of her condition and to protect the
other children.&nbsp; What a joy, what a triumph to say to her
some dear day, a few years hence, &ldquo;You poor, motherless
bairn, we have swept away the cobwebs of your dreams, given you
back your will, put a clue to things in your hand: now go on and
learn to live and be mistress of your own life under
God!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was at such a moment, when Mary&rsquo;s voice trembled, and
her eyes shone through a mist of tears like two victorious stars,
that a hush fell upon the little group, and the spirit of the
eternal child descended like a dove, its pure wings stirring the
silence of each woman&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; At such a moment,
their daily work, with its round of harsh, unlovely, beautiful,
discouraging, hopeful, helpful, heavenly duties, was
transfigured, and so were they.&nbsp; The servant was transformed
by the service, and the service by the servant.&nbsp; They were
alone together, each heart knit to all the others by the close
bond of a common vocation; and though a heretofore unknown
experience, it seemed a natural one when Mistress Mary suddenly
bent her head, and said softly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father in heaven, it is by the vision of Thy relation
to us that we can apprehend our relation to these little
ones.&nbsp; As we have accepted that high trust, so make us loyal
to it.&nbsp; When our feet grow weary and our faith grows dim,
help us to follow close after the ever perfect One who taught
even as we are trying to teach.&nbsp; He it was whom the common
people heard gladly.&nbsp; He it was who disdained not the use of
objects and symbols, remembering it was the childhood of the
race.&nbsp; He it was who spake in parables and stories, laying
bare soul of man and heart of nature, and revealing each by
divine analogy.&nbsp; He it was who took the little ones in His
arms and blessed them; who set the child in the midst, saying,
&ldquo;Except ye become as one of these.&rdquo;&nbsp; May the
afterglow of that inspired teaching ever shine upon the path we
are treading.&nbsp; May we bathe our tired spirits in its warmth
and glory, and kindle our torches at the splendour of its
light.&nbsp; We remember that He told us to feed His lambs.&nbsp;
Dear Lord, help all the faithful shepherds who care for the
ninety-and-nine that lie in the safe cover of the fold; help us,
too, for we are the wandering shepherds whose part it is to go
out over the bleak hills, up the mountain sides and rocky places,
and gather in out of the storm and stress of things all the poor,
unshepherded, wee bit lammies that have either wandered forlornly
away from shelter, or have been born in the wilderness, and know
no other home.&nbsp; Such an one has just strayed into the fold
from the dreary hill-country.&nbsp; It needs a wiser shepherd
than any one of us.&nbsp; Grant that by gentleness, patience, and
insight we may atone somewhat for our lack of wisdom and
skill.&nbsp; We read among Thy mysteries that the divine Child
was born of a virgin.&nbsp; May He be born again and born daily
in our hearts, already touched by that remembrance and
consecrated by its meaning.&nbsp; And this we ask for
love&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then there was a space of silence&mdash;one of those silences
in which we seem to be caught up into the heart of things, when
hidden meanings are revealed, when the soul stretches itself and
grows a little.</p>
<p>It was a few minutes later when Rhoda said, &lsquo;I am fired
with zeal, I confess it.&nbsp; Henceforth my single aim shall be
to bring Marm Lisa into her lost kingdom and inheritance.&nbsp;
But meanwhile, how, oh how shall I master the hateful
preliminaries?&nbsp; How shall I teach her to lace her shoes and
keep them laced, unless I invent a game for it?&nbsp; How shall I
keep her hair from dangling in her eyes, how keep her aprons
neat?&mdash;though in those respects she is no worse than Pacific
Simonson.&nbsp; I promised her a doll yesterday, and she was
remarkably good.&nbsp; Do you object, Mistress Mary?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much rewards are used in these
cases,&rsquo; answered Mary, &lsquo;but why do you begin with
them when the problem presents no insuperable difficulties as
yet?&nbsp; Whenever she herself, her awkward hands, her weak
will, her inattention, her restlessness, give her some task she
likes, some pleasure or occupation for which she has shown
decided preference, and thus make happiness follow close upon the
heels of effort.&nbsp; We who see more clearly the meaning of
life know that this will not always happen, and we can be content
to do right for right&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t object to
your putting hosts of slumbering incentives in Lisa&rsquo;s mind,
but a slumbering incentive is not vulgar and debasing, like a
bribe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A plant might be a feeble and common thing, yet it might grow
in beauty and strength in a garden like Mistress
Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Such soil in the way of surroundings, such
patient cultivation of roots and stems, such strengthening of
tendrils on all sorts of lovely props, such sunshine of love,
such dew of sympathy, such showers of kindness, such favouring
breezes of opportunity, such pleasure for a new leaf, joy for a
bud, gratitude for a bloom!&nbsp; What an atmosphere in which to
grow towards knowledge and goodness!&nbsp; Was it any wonder that
the little people &lsquo;all in a row&rsquo; responded to the
genius of Mistress Mary&rsquo;s influence?&nbsp; They used to
sing a song calleth The Light Bird,&rsquo; in which some one, all
unknown to the children, would slip into the playground with a
bit of broken looking-glass, and suddenly a radiant fluttering
disk of light would appear on the wall, and dance up and down,
above and below, hither and yon, like a winged sunbeam.&nbsp; The
children held out longing arms, and sang to it coaxingly.&nbsp;
Sometimes it quivered over Mistress Mary&rsquo;s head, and fired
every delicate point of her steel tiara with such splendour that
the Irish babies almost felt like crossing themselves.&nbsp; At
such times, those <i>deux petits c&oelig;urs secs</i>, Atlantic
and Pacific, and all the other full-fledged and half-fledged
scape-graces, forgot to be naughty, and the millennium was
foreshadowed.&nbsp; The neophytes declared Mistress Mary a bit of
a magician.&nbsp; Somehow or other, the evil imps in the children
shrank away, abashed by the soft surprise of a glance that seemed
to hope something better, and the good angels came out of their
banishment, unfolded their wings, and sunned themselves in the
warmth of her approving smile.&nbsp; Her spiritual antenn&aelig;
were so fine, so fine, that they discerned the good in
everything; they were feeling now after the soft spot in the
rocky heart of Atlantic Simonson; they had not found it yet, but
they would&mdash;oh, they would in time; for if hope is the
lover&rsquo;s staff, it is no less that of the idealist.</p>
<p>Marm Lisa looked upon the miracles that happened under
Mistress Mary&rsquo;s roof with a sort of dazed wonder, but her
intelligence grew a little day by day; and though she sadly taxed
everybody&rsquo;s patience, she infused a new spirit into all the
neophytes.</p>
<p>Had not improvement been rapid, their untrained zeal might
perhaps have flagged.&nbsp; Had the mental symptoms, by their
obscurity, baffled them or defied them on every side, their lack
of systematic, scientific training for such a task might have
made them discouraged: but delicate and exacting as the work was,
their love and enthusiasm, their insight and patience, their
cleverness and ingenuity, triumphed over all obstacles; and
luckily for their youth and comparative inexperience, they were
rewarded in marvellous measure.</p>
<p>Not that every day was bright and hopeful.&nbsp; The carefully
kept record was black enough on occasions, beginning with the
morning when Helen, sitting in the circle, felt a rough hand on
her head, and Marm Lisa, without the slightest warning of her
intention, snatched Mary&rsquo;s steel band forcibly from her
hair, and, taking it across the room, put it in its accustomed
place on its owner&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Everybody was startled,
but Mary rose from her chair quietly, and, taking the ornament in
one hand and Marm Lisa in the other, she came to Helen&rsquo;s
side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like to have my shining crown in Miss Helen&rsquo;s
hair,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;it is such pretty, curly
hair&mdash;stroke it softly, Lisa; she must wear it this morning
to please me, and then I will take it again for my own.&nbsp;
Dear Miss Helen, who is so sweet and good to the children, I love
her,&rsquo; and she kissed her fondly on each cheek.</p>
<p>Marm Lisa did not attempt to rebel but she was sullen, and
refused her work when it was offered her later.</p>
<p>Such occurrences were rare, however, for her obliquity always
seemed mental rather than moral.</p>
<p>Straws and bright papers, beads and pretty forms to thread on
stout laces, were given her to wean her from her favourite but
aimless string-play.&nbsp; There were days of restlessness which
she wandered up and down stairs, and could not be kept in her
chair nor persuaded to stand in her place in the circle.&nbsp;
There were days, too, when she tore the bright cardboards and
glossy weaving-mats that ordinarily gave her such keen pleasure;
but this carelessness grew more and more infrequent, until it
ceased altogether, so that it had probably come more from her
inability to hold and move the materials and needles properly
than from a wanton instinct of destruction; for they would often
see the tears drop from her eyes upon her clumsy fingers as she
strove to make them obey her feeble behests.&nbsp; At such a
moment there was always some one to fling herself with passionate
ardour and sympathy into this latest difficulty.&nbsp; A stouter
weaving-needle was invented, and a mat of pretty coloured morocco
substituted for the fragile paper; while the poor inert hands
were held and coaxed and strengthened every day by finger
gymnastics.</p>
<p>As Lisa grew in power Rhoda grew in ingenuity, and failure in
any one particular only stimulated her genius of invention the
more.&nbsp; Did she spill paste, mucilage, water on her gingham
aprons, and wipe anything and everything on them that came in her
way, Rhoda dressed her in daintier ones of white cambric, with a
ruffle at the neck and sleeves; the child&rsquo;s pleasure knew
no bounds, and she kept the aprons clean.&nbsp; With Mrs.
Grubb&rsquo;s permission her hair was cut shorter, and brushed
back under a round comb.&nbsp; No regiment of soldiers could have
kept the comb in place.&nbsp; It was taken away and a blue ribbon
substituted.&nbsp; She untied the ribbon every five minutes for
two days, when Mary circumvented her by sewing a blue ribbon on
each sleeve.&nbsp; This seemed to divert her attention from the
head-band, and after a week or two she allowed it to remain
without interference.&nbsp; Mary gave her low shoes, hoping that
the lessened trouble of lacing them would make the task a
possibility.&nbsp; There was no improvement.&nbsp; If she laced
them, it was only under supervision, and they were always untied
within the hour, the dangling laces tripping her awkward
feet.&nbsp; Slippers or old-fashioned shoes with elastic at the
side would have been an easy way out of the difficulty, but to
Rhoda&rsquo;s mind that would have been a humiliating confession
of failure.&nbsp; As a last resort she bought brown shoes and
brown laces.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If these do not succeed,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I will
have red ones made, paint the tips blue, and give her yellow
laces; but I will fix her mind on her feet and arouse her pride
in them, or die in the attempt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This extreme, fortunately, proved unnecessary, since for some
unknown reason the brown foot-gear appealed to Marm Lisa, and she
kept the laces tied.&nbsp; The salient peculiarity and
encouraging feature of the child&rsquo;s development was that,
save in rare cases, she did not slip back into her old habits
when the novelty of the remedy wore off; with her, almost every
point gained was a point kept.&nbsp; It was indeed a high Hill
Difficulty that she was climbing&mdash;so high that had she
realised it she would never have taken the first step of her own
unaided will; but now this impelling force behind her was so
great, and the visions for ever leading her on were so beautiful,
that she ran nor grew weary, she walked yet did not faint.</p>
<p>The other children, even the youngest of them, were more or
less interested in the novel enterprise, too, though they
scarcely knew the nature of it or how much was at stake.&nbsp;
That a human mind was tottering to its fall, and that Mistress
Mary was engaged in preventing it, was beyond their ken.&nbsp;
They could see certain details, however, for they were all one
great family of little people, and it was no unaccustomed thing
for them to watch a moral conquest, though they had no conception
of an intellectual one.</p>
<p>Accordingly, there was a shout of triumph from a corner of the
room one morning,&mdash;such a shout that seventy or eighty
youngsters held their breath to see what was happening.</p>
<p>After weeks upon weeks of torn cards, broken threads, soiled
patterns, wrong stitches, weak hand held in place by strong hand,
Marm Lisa had sewed without help, and in one lesson, the outline
of a huge red apple; and there she stood, offering her finished
work to Mistress Mary.&nbsp; The angels in heaven never rejoiced
more greatly over the one repentant sinner than the tired
shepherdesses over their one poor ewe lamb, as she stood there
with quivering hands and wet eyes, the first sense of conscious
victory written on her inscrutable brow, and within the turbid,
clouded brain the memory of a long struggle, and a hint, at
least, of the glory she had achieved.</p>
<p>Rhoda took the square of neat cardboard with the precious red
circle that meant so much, and ran into the playground with it,
hugging it to her heart, and crying and laughing over it like a
child.</p>
<p>When she came back Mistress Mary put her arm round
Lisa&rsquo;s waist and said to the whole great family:
&lsquo;Children, after trying hard, for ever so long, Lisa has
sewed this lovely picture all by herself.&nbsp; There is not a
wrong stitch, and one side is as neat as the other.&nbsp; What
shall we say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Three cheers!&nbsp; The Chinese must go!&rsquo; shouted
Pat Higgins, a patriotic person of five years, whose father was
an organiser of sand-lot meetings.</p>
<p>All the grown-ups laughed at this unexpected suggestion, but
the cheers were given with a good will, and Marm Lisa, her mind
stirred to its depths by the unwonted emotion, puzzled out the
meaning of them and hid it in her heart.</p>
<h2><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>VI<br
/>
FROM GRUBB TO BUTTERFLY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> children were all nearly a year
older when Mrs. Grubb one day climbed the flight of wooden steps
heading to Marm Lisa&rsquo;s Paradise, and met, as she did so, a
procession of Mistress Mary&rsquo;s neophytes who were wending
their way homeward.</p>
<p>The spectacle of a number of persons of either sex, or of both
sexes, proceeding in hue or grouped as an audience, acted on Mrs.
Grubb precisely as the taste of fresh blood is supposed to act on
a tiger in captivity.&nbsp; At such a moment she had but one
impulse, and that was to address the meeting.&nbsp; The
particular subject was not vital, since it was never the subject,
but her own desire to talk, that furnished the necessary
inspiration.&nbsp; While she was beginning, &lsquo;Ladies and
gentlemen,&rsquo; in her clear, pheasant voice, her convictions,
opinions, views, prejudices, feelings, experiences, all flew from
the different corners of what she was pleased to call her brain,
and focussed themselves on the point in question.</p>
<p>If the discussion were in a field in which she had made no
excursions whatever, that trifling detail did not impose silence
upon her.&nbsp; She simply rose, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ladies and gentlemen, though a stranger in your midst,
I feel I must say a word of sympathy to you, and a word of
encouragement for your cause.&nbsp; It is a good and worthy
movement, and I honour you for upholding it.&nbsp; Often and
often have I said to my classes, it matters not what face of
truth is revealed to you so long as you get a vision that will
help you to bless your fellow-men.&nbsp; To bless your fellow-men
is the great task before each and every one of us, and I feel to
urge this specially upon occasions like this, when I see a large
and influential audience before me.&nbsp; Says Rudyard Kipling,
&ldquo;I saw a hundred men on the road to Delhi, and they were
all my brothers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, all our brothers!&nbsp; The
brotherhood of man and the sisterhood of woman, those are the
subjects that include all others.&nbsp; I am glad to have met
with you, and to have heard the eloquent words of your
speakers.&nbsp; If any of you would like to know more of my work,
I will gladly meet you in Room A at the close of this
meeting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She then sat down amid applause.&nbsp; Never did Mrs. S. Cora
Grubb cease speaking without at least a ripple of approval that
sometimes grew into a positive ovation.&nbsp; What wonder, then,
that she mistook herself for an inspired person?&nbsp; It was
easy to understand her popularity with her fellow-men.&nbsp; Her
eyes were as soft and clear as those of a child, her hair waved
prettily off her low, serene brow, her figure was plump and
womanly, and when her voice trembled with emotion (which in her
was a shallow well very near the surface) the charmingest pink
colour came and went in her cheeks.&nbsp; On such occasions more
than one member of the various brotherhoods thought what a cosy
wife she would make, if removed from the public arena to the
&lsquo;sweet, safe corner of the household fire.&rsquo;&nbsp; To
be sure, she had not much logic, but plenty of sentiment; rather
too great a fondness for humanity, perhaps, but that was because
she had no husband and family of her own to absorb her
superfluous sympathy and energy.&nbsp; Mrs. Grubb was not so
easily classified as these &lsquo;brothers&rsquo; imagined,
however, and fortunately for them she had no leanings towards any
man&rsquo;s fireside.&nbsp; Mr. Grubb had died in the endeavour
to understand her, and it is doubtful whether, had he been
offered a second life and another opportunity, he would have
thought the end justified the means.</p>
<p>This criticism, however, applies only to the family circle,
for Mrs. Grubb in a hall was ever winning, delightful, and
persuasive.&nbsp; If she was illogical, none of her sister-women
realised it, for they were pretty much of the same chaotic order
of mind, though with this difference: that a certain proportion
of them were everywhere seeking reasons for their weariness,
their unhappiness, their poverty, their lack of faith and
courage, their unsatisfactory husbands and their disappointing
children.&nbsp; These ladies were apt to be a trifle bitter, and
much more interested in Equal Suffrage, Temperance, Cremation,
and Edenic Diet than in subjects like Palmistry, Telepathy, and
Hypnotism, which generally attracted the vague, speculative,
feather-headed ones.&nbsp; These discontented persons were always
the most frenzied workers and the most eloquent speakers, and
those who were determined to get more rights were mild compared
with those who were determined to avenge their wrongs.&nbsp;
There was, of course, no unanimity of belief running through all
these Clubs, Classes, Circles, Societies, Orders, Leagues,
Chapters, and Unions; but there was one bond of aversion, and
that was domestic service of any kind.&nbsp; That no woman could
develop or soar properly, and cook, scrub, sweep, dust, wash
dishes, mend, or take care of babies at the same time&mdash;to
defend this proposition they would cheerfully have gone to the
stake.&nbsp; They were willing to concede all these sordid tasks
as an honourable department of woman&rsquo;s work, but each
wanted them to be done by some other woman.</p>
<p>Mrs. Grubb really belonged to neither of these classes.&nbsp;
She was not very keen about more rights, nor very bloodthirsty
about her wrongs.&nbsp; She inhabited a kind of serene twilight,
the sort that follows an especially pink sunset.&nbsp; She was
not wholly clear in her mind about anything, but she was entirely
hopeful about the world and its disposition to grow and move in
ever ascending spirals.&nbsp; She hated housework as much as any
of her followers, although she was seldom allowed to do anything
for herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll step in and make your beds,
Mrs. Grubb; I know you&rsquo;re tired.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll sweep the front room, Mrs. Grubb; you give
yourself out so, I know you need rest.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me
cook your supper while you get up strength for your lecture;
there are plenty of people to cook, but there&rsquo;s only one
Mrs. Grubb!&rsquo;&nbsp; These were the tender solicitations she
was ever receiving.</p>
<p>As for theories, she had small choice.&nbsp; She had looked
into almost every device for increasing the sum of human
knowledge and hastening the millennium, and she thought them all
more or less valuable.&nbsp; Her memory, mercifully, was not a
retentive one, therefore she remembered little of the beliefs she
had outgrown; they never left even a deposit in the stretch of
wet sand in which they had written themselves.</p>
<p>She had investigated, or at any rate taught, Delsarte,
Physical Culture, Dress-Reform, the Blue-glass Cure, Scientific
Physiognomy, Phrenology, Cheiromancy, Astrology, Vegetarianism,
Edenic Diet, Single Tax, Evolution, Mental Healing, Christian
Science, Spiritualism, Theosophy, and Hypnotism.&nbsp; All these
metamorphoses of thought had Mrs. S. Cora Grubb passed through,
and was not yet a finished butterfly.&nbsp; Some of the ideas she
had left far behind, but she still believed in them as fragments
of truth suitable for feeble growing souls that could not bear
the full light of revelation in one burst.&nbsp; She held
honorary memberships in most of the outgrown societies, attended
annual meetings of others, and kept in touch with all the rest by
being present at their social reunions.</p>
<p>One of her present enthusiasms was her &lsquo;Kipling
Brothers,&rsquo; the boys&rsquo; band enlisted under the motto,
&lsquo;I saw a hundred men on the road to Delhi, and they were
all my brothers.&rsquo;&nbsp; She believed that there was no
salvation for a boy outside of a band.&nbsp; Banded somehow he
must be, then badged, beribboned, bannered, and bye-lawed.&nbsp;
From the moment a boy&rsquo;s mother had left off her bye-lows,
Mrs. Grubb wanted him put under bye-laws.&nbsp; She often visited
Mistress Mary with the idea that some time she could interest her
in one of her thousand schemes; but this special call was to see
if the older children, whose neat handiwork she had seen and
admired, could embroider mottoes on cardboard to adorn the
Kipling room at an approaching festival.&nbsp; She particularly
wanted &lsquo;Look not upon the Wine&rsquo; done in blood-red
upon black, and &lsquo;Shun the Filthy Weed&rsquo; in
smoke-colour on bright green.&nbsp; She had in her hand a card
with the points for her annual address noted upon it, for this
sort of work she ordinarily did in the horse-cars.&nbsp; These
ran:</p>
<p class="gutindent">1st.&nbsp; Value of individuality.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>I</i> saw.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">2nd.&nbsp; Value of observation.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I <i>saw</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">3rd.&nbsp; Value of numbers.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
saw a <i>hundred</i> men.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">4th.&nbsp; Importance of belonging to the
male sex.&nbsp; It was <i>men</i> who were seen on the road.</p>
<p class="gutindent">5th.&nbsp; What and where is Delhi?</p>
<p class="gutindent">6th.&nbsp; Description of the road
thither.</p>
<p class="gutindent">7th.&nbsp; Every boy has his Delhi.</p>
<p class="gutindent">8th.&nbsp; Are you &lsquo;on the
road&rsquo;?</p>
<p class="gutindent">9th.&nbsp; The brotherhood of man.</p>
<p class="gutindent">10th.&nbsp; The Kipling Brothers&rsquo; Call
to Arms.</p>
<p>She intended to run through the heads of this impassioned
oration to Mistress Mary, whom she rather liked; and, in truth,
Mary had difficulty in disliking her, though she thoroughly
disapproved of her.&nbsp; She was so amiable, and apparently so
susceptible to teaching, that Mary always fancied her on the
verge of something better.&nbsp; Her vagaries, her neglects, and
what to Mary&rsquo;s mind were positive inhumanities, seemed in a
way unconscious.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I can only get into sufficiently
friendly relations,&rsquo; thought Mary, &lsquo;so that I can
convince her that her first and highest duty lies in the
direction of the three children, I believe she will have the
heroism to do it!&rsquo;&nbsp; But in this Mistress Mary&rsquo;s
instinct was at fault.&nbsp; Mrs. Grubb took indeed no real
cognisance of her immediate surroundings, but she would not have
wished to see near duties any more clearly.&nbsp; Neither had she
any sane and healthy interest in good works of any kind; she
simply had a sort of philanthropic hysteria, and her most
successful speeches were so many spasms.</p>

THE COMET AND THE FIXED STAR</h2>
<p>&lsquo;I <span class="smcap">don&rsquo;t</span> feel that I
can part with Lisa now, just as she&rsquo;s beginning to be a
help to me,&rsquo; argued Mrs. Grubb, shortly after she had been
welcomed and ensconced in a rocking-chair.&nbsp; &lsquo;As Madame
Goldmarker says, nobody else in the world would have given her a
home these four years, and a good many wouldn&rsquo;t have had
her round the house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is true,&rsquo; replied Mary, &lsquo;and your
husband must have been a very good man from all you tell me, Mrs.
Grubb.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good enough, but totally uninteresting,&rsquo; said
that lady laconically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, putting aside the question as to whether goodness
ought to be totally uninteresting, you say that Lisa&rsquo;s
mother left Mr. Grubb three hundred dollars for her food and
clothing, and that she has been ever since a willing servant,
absolutely devoted to your interests.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We never put a cent of the three hundred dollars into
our own pockets,&rsquo; explained Mrs. Grubb.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr.
Grubb was dreadfully opposed to my doing it, but every penny of
it went to freeing our religious society from debt.&nbsp; It was
a case of the greatest good of the greatest number, and I
didn&rsquo;t flinch.&nbsp; I thought it was a good deal more
important that the Army of Present Perfection should have a roof
over its head than that Lisa Bennett should be fed and clothed;
that is, if both could not be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know the creed of the Army, but it seems
to me your Presently Perfect soldiers would have been rather
uncomfortable under their roof if Lisa Bennett had been naked and
starving outside.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it would never have come to that,&rsquo; responded
Mrs. Grubb easily.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is plenty of money in the
world, and it belongs equally to the whole human race.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t recognise anybody&rsquo;s right to have a dollar more
than I have; but Mr. Grubb could never accept any belief that had
been held less than a thousand years, and before he died he gave
some money to a friend of his, and told him to pay me ten dollars
every month towards Lisa&rsquo;s board.&nbsp; Untold gold could
never pay for what my pride has suffered in having her, and if
she hadn&rsquo;t been so useful I couldn&rsquo;t have done
it,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t pretend that I could.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
an offence to the eye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not any longer,&rsquo; said Mary proudly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, she was up to a few months ago; but she would
always do anything for the twins, and though they are continually
getting into mischief she never lets any harm come to them, not
so much as a scratch.&nbsp; If I had taken a brighter child, she
would have been for ever playing on her own account and thinking
of her own pleasure; but if you once get an idea into
Lisa&rsquo;s head of what you expect her to do, she will go on
doing it to the end of the world, and wild horses couldn&rsquo;t
keep her from it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pity more of us hadn&rsquo;t that virtue
of obedience to a higher law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, perhaps it is, and perhaps it isn&rsquo;t;
it&rsquo;s a sign of a very weak mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or a very strong one,&rsquo; retorted Mary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are natural leaders and natural followers,&rsquo;
remarked Mrs. Grubb smilingly, as she swayed to and fro in
Mary&rsquo;s rocking-chair.&nbsp; Her smile, like a
ballet-dancer&rsquo;s, had no connection with, nor relation to,
the matter of her speech or her state of feeling; it was what a
watchmaker would call a detached movement.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t see,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;that it is my duty to
send Lisa away to be taught, just when I need her most.&nbsp; My
development is a good deal more important than hers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&nbsp; Because I have a vocation and a mission;
because, if I should falter or faint by the wayside, hundreds of
women who depend on me for inspiration would fall back into error
and suffer permanent loss and injury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you suppose they really would?&rsquo; asked Mary
rather maliciously, anxious if possible to ruffle the surface of
Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s exasperating placidity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Or would
they, of course after a long period of grief-stricken apathy,
attach themselves to somebody else&rsquo;s classes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They might,&rsquo; allowed Mrs. Grubb, in a tone of
hurt self-respect; &lsquo;though you must know, little as
you&rsquo;ve seen of the world, that no woman has just the same
revelation as any other, and that there are some who are born to
interpret truth to the multitude.&nbsp; I can say in all humility
that it has been so with me from a child.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always
had a burning desire to explore the secret chambers of Thought,
always yearned to understand and explain the universe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have never tried to explain it,&rsquo; sighed Mary a
little wearily; &lsquo;one is so busy trying to keep one&rsquo;s
little corner clean and sweet and pleasant, a helpful place where
sad and tired souls can sit down and rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who wants to sit down and rest?&nbsp; Not I!&rsquo;
exclaimed Mrs. Grubb.&nbsp; &lsquo;But then, I&rsquo;m no
criterion, I have such an active mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are just a few passive virtues,&rsquo; said Mary
teasingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;We must remember that activity
doesn&rsquo;t always make for good; sometimes it is unrest,
disintegration; not growth, Mrs. Grubb, but
fermentation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Grubb took out a small blank-book and made a note, for
she had an ear for any sentence that might be used in a
speech.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is true.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Distrust the activity
which is not growth</i>, <i>but fermentation</i>&rdquo; that will
just hit some ladies in my classes, and it comes right in with
something I am going to say this evening.&nbsp; We have a Diet
Congress here this week, and there&rsquo;s a good deal of feeling
and dispute between the various branches.&nbsp; I have two
delegates stopping with me, and they haven&rsquo;t spoken to each
other since yesterday morning, nor sat down to eat at the same
table.&nbsp; I shall do all I can, as the presiding officer, to
keep things pleasant at the meetings, but it will be
difficult.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve never been in public life and
can&rsquo;t understand it, but you see there are women among the
delegates who&rsquo;ve suffered the tyranny of man so long that
they will cook anything their husbands demand; women who believe
in eating any kind of food, and hold that the principal trouble
lies in bad cooking; women who will give up meat, but still
indulge in all sorts of cakes, pastries, and kickshaws; and women
who are strong on temperance in drink, but who see no need of
temperance in food.&nbsp; The whole question of diet reform is in
an awful state, and a Congress is the only way to settle
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do men stand on the diet question?&rsquo; asked
Mary, with a twinkle in her eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They don&rsquo;t stand at all,&rsquo; answered Mrs.
Grubb promptly.&nbsp; &lsquo;They sit right still, and some of
them lie down flat, you might say, whenever it&rsquo;s
mentioned.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll do even more for temperance than
they will for reformed diet, though goodness knows they&rsquo;re
fond enough of drinking.&nbsp; The Edenites number about
sixty-seven in this city, and nine is the largest number of
gentlemen that we&rsquo;ve been able to interest.&nbsp; Those
nine are the husbands and sons of the lady members, and at the
next meeting two of them are going to be expelled for
backsliding.&nbsp; I declare, if I was a man, I&rsquo;d be
ashamed to confess that I was all stomach; but that&rsquo;s what
most of them are.&nbsp; Not that it&rsquo;s easy work to be an
Edenite: it&rsquo;s impossible to any but a highly spiritual
nature.&nbsp; I have been on the diet for six months, and nothing
but my position as vice-president of the society, and my desire
to crush the body and release the spirit, could have kept me
faithful.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t pretend to like it, but that
doesn&rsquo;t make me disloyal.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing I
enjoy better than a good cut of underdone beef, with plenty of
dish gravy; I love nice tender porter-house steaks with
mushrooms; I love thick mutton-chops broiled over a hot fire: but
I can&rsquo;t believe in them, and my conscience won&rsquo;t
allow me to eat them.&nbsp; Do you believe in meat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you say
&ldquo;certainly.&rdquo;&nbsp; You would be a good deal better
off without it.&nbsp; You are filling yourself full of carnal,
brutal, murderous passions every time you eat it.&nbsp; The
people who eat meat are not half so elevated nor half so
teachable as the Edenites.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Edenites are possibly too weak and hungry to resist
instruction,&rsquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are neither weak nor hungry,&rsquo; replied their
vice-president, with dignity.&nbsp; &lsquo;They eat milk, and
stewed fruit, and all the edible grains nicely boiled.&nbsp; It
stands to reason that if you can subdue your earthly, devilish,
sensual instincts on anything, you can do it on a diet like
that.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t fancy an angel or a Mahatma devouring
underdone beef.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; agreed Mistress Mary; &lsquo;but for that
matter, the spectacle of an angel eating dried-apple sauce
doesn&rsquo;t appeal to my imagination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no joking matter,&rsquo; said Mrs. Grubb,
with real tears in her eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was my interest in
Theosophy that brought me to the Edenic diet.&nbsp; I have good
and sufficient motives for denying my appetite, for I&rsquo;ve
got a certain goal to reach, and I&rsquo;m in earnest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then here&rsquo;s my hand, and I respect you for
it.&nbsp; Oh, how I should like a hot mutton-chop at this
moment!&mdash;Do forgive me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I forgive you, because I can see you act up to all the
light that has been revealed to you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know as
I ought to be proud because I see so much truth.&nbsp; My classes
tell me I get these marvellous revelations because I&rsquo;m so
open-minded.&nbsp; Now Mr. Grubb wouldn&rsquo;t and
couldn&rsquo;t bear discussion of any sort.&nbsp; His soul never
grew, for he wouldn&rsquo;t open a clink where a new idea might
creep in.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d always accompany me to all my meetings
(such advantages as that man had and missed!), and sometimes
he&rsquo;d take the admission tickets; but when the speaking
began, he&rsquo;d shut the door and stay out in the entry by
himself till it was time to wait upon me home.&nbsp; Do you
believe in vaccination?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it passes my comprehension how you can be so sure
of your beliefs.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better come and hear some of
the arguments on the opposite side.&nbsp; I am the secretary of
the Anti-Vaccination League.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Mrs. Grubb was
especially happy in her anti-societies; negatives seemed to give
her more scope for argument.)&nbsp; &lsquo;I say to my classes,
&ldquo;You must not blame those to whom higher truths do not
appeal, for refusing to believe in that which they cannot
understand; but you may reprove them for decrying or ridiculing
those laws or facts of nature which they have never investigated
with an unprejudiced mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, I must be
going.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve sat longer than I meant to, this room is
so peaceful and comfortable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what about Lisa&rsquo;s future?&nbsp; We
haven&rsquo;t settled that, although we&rsquo;ve had a most
interesting and illuminating conversation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve told you how I feel about her, and you
must respect my feeling.&nbsp; The world can only grow when each
person allows his fellow-man complete liberty of thought and
action.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve kept the child four years, and now when
my good care and feeding, together with the regular work and
early hours I&rsquo;ve always prescribed, have begun to show
their fruits in her improved condition, you want she should be
put in some institution.&nbsp; Why, isn&rsquo;t she doing well
enough as she is?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve had a
wonderful influence over her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing could induce me to lose sight of her
entirely,&rsquo; said Mistress Mary, &lsquo;but we feel now that
she is ready to take the next step.&nbsp; She needs a skilled
physician who is master both of body and mind, as well as a
teacher who is capable of following out his principles.&nbsp; I
will see to all that, if you will only give me the
privilege.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Grubb sank down in the rocking-chair in despair.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t I need some consideration as well as that
little imbecile?&nbsp; Am I, with my ambitions and aspirations,
to be for ever hampered by these three nightmares of
children?&nbsp; Oh, if I could once get an astral body, I would
stay in it, you may be sure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not absolutely need Lisa yourself,&rsquo; argued
Mary.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is the twins to whom she has been
indispensable.&nbsp; Provide for them in some way, and she is
freed from a responsibility for which she is not, and never was,
fit.&nbsp; It is a miracle that some tragedy has not come out of
this daily companionship of three such passionate, irresponsible
creatures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some tragedy will come out of it yet,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Grubb gloomily, &lsquo;if I am not freed from the shackles that
keep me in daily slavery.&nbsp; The twins are as likely to go to
the gallows as anywhere; and as for Lisa, she would be a good
deal better off dead than alive, as Mrs. Sylvester
says.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That isn&rsquo;t for us to decide,&rsquo; said Mistress
Mary soberly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I might have been careless and
impertinent enough to say it a year ago, but not now.&nbsp; Lisa
has all along been the victim of cruel circumstances.&nbsp;
Wherever she has been sinned against through ignorance, it is
possible, barely possible, that the fault may be atoned for; but
any neglect of duty now would be a criminal offence.&nbsp; It
does not behove us to be too scornful when we remember that the
taint (fortunately a slight one) transmitted to poor little Lisa
existed in greater or less degree in Handel and Moli&egrave;re,
Julius C&aelig;sar, Napoleon, Petrarch, and Mohammed.&nbsp; The
world is a good deal richer for them, certainly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Grubb elevated her head, the light of interest dawned in
her eye, and she whipped her notebook out of her pocket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that a fact?&rsquo; she asked excitedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a fact.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it generally known?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must be known by all who have any interest in the
education of defective persons, since it touches one of the
bug-bears which they have to fight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there any society in this city devoted to the study
of such problems?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a society which is just on the point of
opening an institution for the training of defective
children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s face fell, and her hand relaxed its grasp
upon the pencil.&nbsp; (If there was anything she enjoyed, it was
the sensation of being a pioneer in any movement.)&nbsp;
Presently she brightened again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it is just starting,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;then it
must need more members, and speakers to stir up the
community.&nbsp; Now, I am calculated, by constant association
with a child of this character, to be of signal service to the
cause.&nbsp; Not many persons have had my chance to observe
phenomena.&nbsp; Just give me a letter to the
president,&mdash;have they elected officers yet?&mdash;where do
they meet?&mdash;and tell him I&rsquo;ll call on him and throw
all the weight of my influence on his side.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
wonderful!&nbsp; Handel, Moli&egrave;re, Buddha, was
it&mdash;Buddha?&mdash;C&aelig;sar, Petrarch, and
Wellington,&mdash;no, not Wellington.&nbsp; Never mind,
I&rsquo;ll get a list from you to-morrow and look it all
up,&mdash;it&rsquo;s perfectly marvellous!&nbsp; And I have one
of this great, unhappy, suffering class in my own family, one who
may yet be transformed into an Elizabeth Browning or a Joan of
Arc!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mistress Mary sighed in her heart.&nbsp; She learned more of
Mrs. Grubb with every interview, and she knew that her
enthusiasms were as discouraging as her apathies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How unlucky that I mentioned Napoleon, C&aelig;sar, and
Mohammed!&rsquo; she thought.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall be haunted now
by the fear that she will go on a lecturing-tour through the
country, and exhibit poor Lisa as an interesting example.&nbsp;
Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s mind is like nothing so much as a
crazy-quilt.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>VIII<br />
THE YOUNG MINISTER&rsquo;S PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s</span> interest in the
education of the defective classes was as short-lived as it was
ardent.&nbsp; One interview with the president of the society
convinced her that he was not a person to be &lsquo;helped&rsquo;
according to her understanding of the term.&nbsp; She thought him
a self-sufficient gentleman, inflexible in demeanour, and
inhospitable to anybody&rsquo;s ideas or anybody&rsquo;s hobbies
but his own.&nbsp; She resented his praise of Mistress Mary and
Rhoda, and regarded it fulsome flattery when he alluded to their
experiment with Marm Lisa as one of the most interesting and
valuable in his whole experience; saying that he hardly knew
which to admire and venerate the more&mdash;the genius of the
teachers, or the devotion, courage, and docility of the
pupil.</p>
<p>In the summer months Lisa had gone to the country with
Mistress Mary and Edith, who were determined never to lose sight
of her until the end they sought was actually attained.&nbsp;
There, in the verdant freshness of that new world, Lisa
experienced a strange exaltation of the senses.&nbsp; Every
wooded path unfolded treasures of leafy bud, blossom, and brier,
and of beautiful winged things that crept and rustled among the
grasses.&nbsp; There was the ever new surprise of the first
wild-flowers, the abounding mystery of the bird&rsquo;s note and
the brook&rsquo;s song, the daily greeting of bees and
butterflies, frogs and fishes, field-mice and squirrels; so that
the universe, which in the dead past had been dreary and without
meaning, suddenly became warm and friendly, and she, the alien,
felt a sense of kinship with all created things.</p>
<p>Helen had crossed the continent to imbibe the wisdom of the
East, and had brought back stores of knowledge to spend in
Lisa&rsquo;s service; but Rhoda&rsquo;s sacrifice was perhaps the
most complete, for Mrs. Grubb having at first absolutely refused
to part with Lisa, Rhoda had flung herself into the breach and
taken the twins to her mother&rsquo;s cottage in the
mountains.</p>
<p>She came up the broad steps, on a certain appointed day in
August, leading her charges into Mistress Mary&rsquo;s
presence.&nbsp; They were clean, well dressed, and somewhat calm
in demeanour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may go into the playground,&rsquo; she said, after
the greetings were over; &lsquo;and remember that there are sharp
spikes on the high fence by the pepper-tree.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; she went on impressively, closing the
doors and glancing about the room to see if there were any
listeners, &lsquo;Mary, those children have been with me eight
weeks, and I do&mdash;not&mdash;like&mdash;them.&nbsp; What are
you going to do with me?&nbsp; Wait, I haven&rsquo;t told you the
whole truth,&mdash;I dislike them actively.&nbsp; As for my
mother, she is not committed to any theory about the essential
integrity of infancy, and she positively abhors them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then they are no more likable in the bosom of the
family than they have been here?&rsquo; asked Mary, in a tone of
disappointment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;More likable?&nbsp; They are less so!&nbsp; Do you see
any change in me,&mdash;a sort of spiritual effulgence, a saintly
radiance, such as comes after a long spell of persistent
virtue?&nbsp; Because there ought to be, if my summer has served
its purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor dear rosy little martyr!&nbsp; Sit down and tell
me all about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we have kept a log, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;<i>We</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; What, Rhoda! did you
drag your poor mother into the experiment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother?&nbsp; No, she generally locked herself in her
room when the twins were indoors, but&mdash;well, of course, I
had help of one sort and another with them.&nbsp; I have held to
your plan of discipline pretty well; at any rate, I haven&rsquo;t
administered corporal punishment, although, if I had whipped them
whenever they actually needed it, I should have worn out all the
young minister&rsquo;s slippers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary groaned.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then there was another young
minister?&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference, Rhoda,
whether you spend your summers in the woods or by the sea, in the
valleys or on the mountains, there is always a young
minister.&nbsp; Have all the old ones perished off the face of
the earth, pray?&nbsp; And what do the young ones see in you, you
dear unregenerate, that they persist in following you about
threatening my peace of mind and your future career?&nbsp; Well,
go on!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Debarred from the use of the persuasive but obsolete
slipper,&rsquo; Rhoda continued evasively, &lsquo;I tried milder
means of discipline,&mdash;solitary confinement for one not very
much, you know,&mdash;only seventeen times in eight weeks.&nbsp;
I hope you don&rsquo;t object to that?&nbsp; Of course, it was in
a pleasant room with southern exposure, good view, and good
ventilation, a thermometer, picture-books, and all that.&nbsp; It
would have worked better if the twins hadn&rsquo;t always taken
the furniture to pieces, and mother is so fussy about anything of
that sort.&nbsp; She finally suggested the winter bedroom for
Atlantic&rsquo;s incarceration, as it has nothing in it but a
huge coal-stove enveloped in a somewhat awe-inspiring cotton
sheet.&nbsp; I put in a comfortable low chair, a checkerboard,
and some books, fixing the time limit at half an hour.&nbsp; By
the way, Mary, that&rsquo;s such a pretty idea of yours to leave
the door unlocked, and tell the children to come out of their own
accord whenever they feel at peace with the community.&nbsp; I
tried it,&mdash;oh, I always try your pretty ideas first; but I
had scarcely closed the door before Pacific was out of it again,
a regenerated human being according to her own account.&nbsp; But
to return to Atlantic.&nbsp; I went to him when the clock struck,
only to discover that he had broken in the circles of isinglass
round the body of the coal-stove, removed the ashes with a book,
got the dampers out of order, and taken the doors off the
hinges!&nbsp; I am sure Mrs. Grubb is right to keep them on
bread-and-milk and apple-sauce; a steady diet of beef and mutton
would give them a simply unconquerable energy.&nbsp; Oh, laugh as
you may, I could never have lived through the ordeal if it
hadn&rsquo;t been for the young minister!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean that he became interested in the
twins?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes!&mdash;very deeply interested.&nbsp; You have
heard me speak of him: it was Mr. Fielding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Rhoda, he was the last summer&rsquo;s minister,
the one who preached at the sea-shore.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly; but he was only supplying a pulpit there;
now he has his own parish.&nbsp; He is taking up a course of
child-study, and asked me if he was at liberty to use the twins
for psychological observations.&nbsp; I assented most gratefully,
thinking, you know, that he couldn&rsquo;t study them unless he
kept them with him a good deal; but he counted without his host,
as you can imagine.&nbsp; He lives at the hotel until his cottage
is finished, and the first thing I knew he had hired a stout
nursemaid as his contribution to the service of humanity.&nbsp; I
think he was really sorry for me, for I was so confined I could
scarcely ever ride, or drive, or play tennis; and besides, he
simply had to have somebody to hold the children while he
observed them.&nbsp; We succeeded better after the nurse came,
and we all had delightful walks and conversations together, just
a nice little family party!&nbsp; The hotel people called
Atlantic the Cyclone, and Pacific the Warrior.&nbsp; Sometimes
strangers took us for the children&rsquo;s parents, and that was
embarrassing; not that I mind being mistaken for a parent, but I
decline being credited, or discredited, with the maternity of
those imps!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are altogether new in my experience,&rsquo;
confessed Mary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is just what the young minister said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will he keep up his psychological investigation during
the autumn?&rsquo; Mary inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He really has no material there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What will he do, then?&mdash;carry it on by
correspondence?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, that is always unsatisfactory.&nbsp; I fancy he
will come here occasionally: it is the most natural place, and he
is especially eager to meet you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course!&rsquo; said Mistress Mary, reciting
provokingly:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My lyre I tune, my voice I raise,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But with my numbers mix my sighs,<br />
And whilst I sing Euphelia&rsquo;s praise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I fix my soul on Chloe&rsquo;s
eyes.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;How delightful,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;how inspiring
it is to see a young man so devoted to science, particularly to
this neglected science!&nbsp; I shall be charmed to know more of
his psychology and observe his observations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is extremely clever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no doubt of it from what you tell me, both
clever and ingenious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And his cottage is lovely; it will be finished and
furnished by next summer,&mdash;Queen Anne, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, this was so purely irrelevant that there was a wicked
hint of intention about it; and though Mistress Mary was smiling
(and quaking) in the very depths of her heart, she cruelly led
back the conversation into safe educational channels.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it curious,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that we
should have thought Lisa, not the twins, the impossible
problem?&nbsp; Yet, as I have written you, her solution is
something to which we can look forward with reasonable
confidence.&nbsp; It is scarcely eighteen months, but the work
accomplished is almost incredible, even to me, and I have watched
and counted every step.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The only explanation must be this,&rsquo; said Rhoda,
&lsquo;that her condition was largely the fruit of neglect and
utter lack of comprehension.&nbsp; The state of mind and body in
which she came to us was out of all proportion to the moving
cause, when we discovered it.&nbsp; Her mother thought she would
be an imbecile, the Grubbs treated her as one, and nobody cared
to find out what she really was or could be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her brain had been writ upon by the &ldquo;moving
finger,&rdquo;&rsquo; quoted Mary, &lsquo;though the writing was
not graved so deep but that love and science could erase
it.&nbsp; You remember the four lines in Omar Khayy&agrave;m?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The moving finger writes; and,
having writ,<br />
Moves on: nor all your piety nor wit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall lure it back to cancel half a line,<br />
Nor all your tears wash out a word of it.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Edith says I will hardly know her,&rsquo; said
Rhoda.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is true.&nbsp; The new physician is a genius, and
physically and outwardly she has changed more in the last three
months than in the preceding year.&nbsp; She dresses herself
neatly now, braids her own hair, and ties her ribbons
prettily.&nbsp; Edith has kept up her gymnastics, and even taught
her to row and play nine-pins.&nbsp; For the first time in my
life, Rhoda, I can fully understand a mother&rsquo;s passion for
a crippled, or a blind, or a defective child.&nbsp; I suppose it
was only Lisa&rsquo;s desperate need that drew us to her at
first.&nbsp; We all loved and pitied her, even at the very height
of her affliction; but now she fascinates me.&nbsp; I know no
greater pleasure than the daily miracle of her growth.&nbsp; She
is to me the sister I never had, the child I never shall
have.&nbsp; When we think of our success with this experiment, we
must try to keep our faith in human nature, even under the trying
ordeal of the twins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My faith in human nature is absolutely intact,&rsquo;
answered Rhoda; &lsquo;the trouble is that the Warrior and the
Cyclone are not altogether human.&nbsp; Atlantic is the coldest
creature I ever knew,&mdash;so cold that he could stand the
Shadrach-Meshech-and Abednego test with impunity; Pacific is
hot,&mdash;so hot-tempered that one can hardly touch her without
being scorched.&nbsp; If I had money enough to conduct an
expensive experiment, I would separate them, and educate Pacific
at the North Pole, and Atlantic in the Tropics.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If they are not distinctly human, we must allow them a
few human virtues at least,&rsquo; said Mary; &lsquo;for example,
their loyalty to each other.&nbsp; Pacific, always at war with
the community, seldom hurts her brother; Atlantic, selfish and
grasping with all the world, shares generously with his
sister.&nbsp; We must remember, too, that Lisa&rsquo;s care has
been worse than nothing for them, notwithstanding its absolute
fidelity; and their dependence has been a positive injury to
her.&nbsp; There! she has just come into the playground with
Edith.&nbsp; Will wonders never cease?&nbsp; Pacific is embracing
her knees, and Atlantic allows himself to be hugged!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marm Lisa was indeed beside herself with joy at the
meeting.&nbsp; She clung to the infant rebels, stroked their
hair, admired their aprons, their clean hands, their new boots;
and, on being smartly slapped by Atlantic for putting the elastic
of his hat behind his ears, kissed his hand as if it had offered
a caress.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s so little,&rsquo; she said
apologetically, looking up with wet eyes to Edith, who stood
near.</p>
<h2><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>IX<br />
MARM LISA&rsquo;S QUEST</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not long after this
conversation that the twins awoke one morning with a very frenzy
of adventure upon them.&nbsp; It was accompanied by a violent
reaction against all the laws of God and man, and a desire to
devour the tree of knowledge, fruit, limbs, and trunk, no matter
at what cost.</p>
<p>We have no means of knowing whether there was an excess of
electricity in the atmosphere, whether their youthful livers were
disordered, or whether the Evil One was personally conducting the
day&rsquo;s exercises; judged by the light of subsequent events,
all of these suppositions might easily have been true.&nbsp;
During the morning they so demeaned themselves that all Mistress
Mary&rsquo;s younger neophytes became apostates to the true
faith, and went over in a body to the theory of the total
depravity of unbaptized infants.</p>
<p>In the afternoon they did not appear, nor did Marm Lisa.&nbsp;
This was something that had never occurred before, save when
Pacific had a certain memorable attack of mumps that would have
carried off any child who was fitted for a better world, or one
who was especially beloved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you suppose anything is wrong?&rsquo; asked Mary
nervously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course not,&rsquo; said Edith.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
remember seeing Lisa in the playground at one o&rsquo;clock, but
my impression is that she was alone, and stayed only a
moment.&nbsp; At any rate, I was very busy and did not speak to
her.&nbsp; Mrs. Grubb has probably taken the twins to have their
hair cut, or something of that sort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a ridiculous suggestion!&rsquo; exclaimed
Rhoda.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know perfectly well that Mrs. Grubb would
never think of cutting their hair, if it swept the earth!&nbsp;
She may possibly have taken them to join a band; they must be
getting to a proper age for membership.&nbsp; At any rate, I will
call there and inquire, on my way home, although I can never talk
to Mrs. Grubb two minutes without wanting to shake
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda made her promised visit, but the house was closed and
the neighbours knew nothing of the whereabouts of the children
beyond the fact that Mrs. Grubb was seen talking to them as she
went into the yard, a little after twelve o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;
Rhoda naturally concluded, therefore, that Edith&rsquo;s
supposition must be correct, and that Mrs. Grubb had for once
indulged in a family excursion.</p>
<p>Such was not the case, however.&nbsp; After luncheon, Marm
Lisa had washed the twins&rsquo; hands and faces in the back-yard
as usual, and left them for an instant to get a towel from the
kitchen.&nbsp; When she returned, she looked blankly about, for
there was no sign of the two dripping faces and the uplifted
streaming hands.&nbsp; They had a playful habit of hiding from
her, knowing that in no other way could they make her so unhappy;
so she stood still for some moments, calling them, at first
sharply, then piteously, but with no result.&nbsp; She ran to the
front gate; it was closed; the rope-fastening was out of reach,
and plainly too complicated even for their preternatural
powers.&nbsp; She hurried back to the house, and searched every
room in a bewildered sort of fashion, finding nothing.&nbsp; As
she came out again, her eye caught sight of a kitchen chair in
the corner of the yard.&nbsp; They had climbed the picket fence,
then.&nbsp; Yes; Atlantic, while availing himself of its
unassuming aid, had left a clue in a fragment of his
trousers.&nbsp; She opened the gate, and ran breathlessly along
the streets to that Garden of Eden where joy had always hitherto
awaited her.&nbsp; Some instinct of fear or secrecy led her to go
quietly through all the rooms and search the playground without
telling any one of her trouble.&nbsp; That accomplished
fruitlessly, she fled home again, in the vain hope of finding the
children in some accustomed haunt overlooked in her first
search.&nbsp; She began to be thoroughly alarmed now, and
thoroughly confused.&nbsp; With twitching hands and nervous
shaking of the head, she hurried through the vacant rooms,
growing more and more aimless in her quest.&nbsp; She climbed on
a tall bureau and looked in a tiny medicine cupboard; then under
the benches and behind the charts in the parlour; even under the
kitchen sink, among the pots and pans, and in the stove, where
she poked tremulously among the ashes.&nbsp; Her newfound wit
seemed temporarily to have deserted her, and she was a pitiable
thing as she wandered about, her breath coming in long-drawn
sighs, with now and then a half-stifled sob.</p>
<p>Suddenly she darted into the street again.&nbsp; Perhaps they
had followed their aunt Cora.&nbsp; Distance had no place in her
terror-stricken heart.&nbsp; She traversed block after block,
street after street, until she reached Pocahontas Hall, a
building and locality she knew well.&nbsp; She crept softly up
the main stairs, and from the landing slipped into the gallery
above.&nbsp; Mrs. Grubb sat in the centre of the stage, with a
glass of water, a bouquet of roses, and a bundle of papers and
tracts on the table by her side.&nbsp; In the audience were
twenty or thirty women and a dozen men, their laps filled, and
their pockets bulging, with propaganda.&nbsp; They stood at
intervals to ask superfluous or unanswerable questions, upon
which Mrs. Grubb would rise and reply, with cheeks growing pink
and pinker, with pleasant smile and gracious manner, and a voice
fairly surcharged with conviction.&nbsp; Most of the ladies took
notes, and a girl with a receding chin was seated at a small
table in front of the platform, making a stenographic report.</p>
<p>All this Marm Lisa saw, but her eyes rested on nothing she
longed to see.&nbsp; Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s lecture voice rose and
fell melodiously, floating up to her balcony heights in a kind of
echo that held the tone, but not the words.&nbsp; The voice made
her drowsy, for she was already worn out with emotion, but she
roused herself with an effort, and stole down the stairs to
wander into the street again.&nbsp; Ah, there was an idea!&nbsp;
The coat-shop!&nbsp; Why had she not thought of it before?</p>
<p>The coat-shop was a sort of clothing manufactory on a small
scale, a tall, narrow building four stories high, where she had
often gone with Atlantic and Pacific.&nbsp; There were
sewing-machines on the ground-floor, the cutters and pressers
worked in the middle stories, and at the top were the
finishers.&nbsp; It was neither an extensive nor an exciting
establishment, and its only fascination lay in the fact that the
workwomen screamed with laughter at the twins&rsquo;
conversation, and after leading them to their utmost length,
teasing and goading them into a towering passion, would stuff
them with nuts or dates or cheap sweetmeats.&nbsp; The coat-shop
was two or three miles from the hall, and it was closing time and
quite dark when Lisa arrived.&nbsp; She came out of the door
after having looked vainly in every room, and sat down dejectedly
in the entrance, with her weary head leaning against the
wall.&nbsp; There was but a moment&rsquo;s respite for her, for
the manager came out of his office, and, stumbling over her in
the dusk, took her by the shoulders and pushed her into the
street with an oath.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go and sit on your own doorstep, can&rsquo;t
you?&rsquo; he muttered, &lsquo;and not make me break my legs
over you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was too spent to run any further.&nbsp; She dragged her
heavy feet along slowly, almost unconsciously, neither knowing
nor caring whither they led her.&nbsp; Home she could not, dared
not go, bearing that heavy burden of remorse!&nbsp; Mrs. Grubb
would ask for Atlantic and Pacific, and then what would become of
her?&nbsp; Mr. Grubb would want to give Pacific her milk.&nbsp;
No, Mr. Grubb was dead.&nbsp; There! she hadn&rsquo;t looked in
the perambulator.&nbsp; No, there wasn&rsquo;t any
perambulator.&nbsp; That was dead, too, and gone away with Mr.
Grubb.&nbsp; There used to be babies, two babies, in the
perambulator.&nbsp; What had become of them?&nbsp; Were they
lost, too?&nbsp; And the umbrella that she used to hold until her
arm ached, and the poor, pale, weeping mother always lying on a
bed,&mdash;were they all gone together?&nbsp; Her head buzzed
with worrying, unrelated thoughts, so that she put up her hands
and held it in place on her shoulders as she shuffled wearily
along.&nbsp; A heavy, dripping mist began to gather and fall, and
she shivered in the dampness, huddling herself together and
leaning against the houses for a shelter.&nbsp; She sat down on
the curb-stone and tried to think, staring haggardly at the sign
on the corner fruit-shop.&nbsp; In that moment she suddenly
forgot the reason of her search.&nbsp; She had
lost&mdash;what?&nbsp; She could not go home to Eden Place, but
why?&nbsp; Oh yes!&nbsp; It came to her now: there was something
about a perambulator, but it all seemed vague to her.&nbsp;
Suddenly a lamplighter put his ladder against a post in front of
her, and, climbing up nimbly, lighted the gas-jet inside of the
glass frame.&nbsp; It shone full on a flight of broad steps, a
picture so much a part of her life-dream that she would go up to
the very gate of heaven with its lines burned into her heart and
brain.</p>
<p>She crept up and turned the knob of the outer door.&nbsp; It
was unlocked, and she stole into the inner room, the Paradise,
place of joy and sweet content, heart&rsquo;s rest, soul&rsquo;s
heaven, love&rsquo;s own abode.&nbsp; The very atmosphere soothed
her.&nbsp; She heard the janitress clatter through the halls,
lock the door, and descend the stairs to her own rooms in the
basement.&nbsp; The light from the street lamps shone in at the
two end windows, so that the room was not in utter
darkness.&nbsp; She would lie down here and die with Mr. Grubb
and the babies and the umbrella.&nbsp; Atlantic and Pacific would
be sure to come back; nobody who had ever known it could live
without this place.&nbsp; Miss Mary would find them.&nbsp; She
would make everything right.&nbsp; The mere thought of Mistress
Mary brought a strange peace into poor Lisa&rsquo;s over-wrought,
distraught mind.</p>
<p>She opened the closet door.&nbsp; It was as dainty and neat as
Mistress Mary herself, and the mere sight of it bred order in
Lisa&rsquo;s thoughts.&nbsp; On the top of a pile of envelopes
lay the sewing-picture that Atlantic had spoiled that day.&nbsp;
It had been a black morning, and the bit of cardboard was torn
and soiled and bent.&nbsp; Lisa looked at it with a maternal and
a prophetic eye.&nbsp; She could see the firm line of
Rhoda&rsquo;s lip as she bore down upon the destructive
urchin.&nbsp; She could almost hear the bright challenging tone
as Rhoda would say: &lsquo;Now, Atlantic, let us see what we can
do!&nbsp; Cut off the chewed edges with these scissors, paste
these thin pieces of paper over the torn places, and rub the card
with this crust of bread.&nbsp; A new one?&nbsp; Certainly
<i>not</i>, my young friend!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lisa took the poor little object in her hand, and, seeing
Mistress Mary&rsquo;s white apron, pressed her cheek against it
in a transport of tenderness and hung it over her arm.&nbsp; Just
then she caught sight of the clay bird&rsquo;s-nest that Pacific
had modelled&mdash;such a lovely bird&rsquo;s-nest that it had
been kept for the cabinet.&nbsp; She carried her treasures over
to the old-fashioned lounge where the babies took their
occasional nap, put them carefully in a small red chair close
beside it, and then, stretching her weary length on the cushions,
she kissed the smooth folds of the apron, and clasped it in her
arms.</p>
<p>Mistress Mary would come soon.&nbsp; She would come in her
cloud of white, and her steel fillet would gleam and shine when
the sunshine fell upon it, and make star-rays and moonbeams and
lightning-flashes; and the tiny points would twinkle and wink and
laugh and blink whenever she turned her head.&nbsp; She would
smile, and everything would suddenly be clear; she would speak,
and the weary buzzing of windmills in the brain would be
hushed.&nbsp; Under her touch the darkness and heaviness would
vanish, and there would be no more night there&mdash;no more
night.</p>
<p>As these healing visions stole upon Marm Lisa, the torture and
the anguish, the long hours of bewilderment, faded little by
little, little by little, till at length a blessed sleep crept
over her eyelids, blotting into a merciful nothingness the terror
and the misery of the day.</p>
<h2><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>X<br
/>
THE TWINS JOIN THE CELESTIALS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span>, Atlantic and Pacific had
been enjoying themselves even unto the verge of delirium.&nbsp;
In the course of their wanderings they had come upon a Chinaman
bearing aloft a huge red silken banner crowned by a
badger&rsquo;s tail.&nbsp; Everything young that had two legs was
following him, and they joined the noble army of followers.&nbsp;
As they went on, other Chinamen with other banners came from the
side-alleys, and all at once the small procession thus formed
turned a corner and came upon the parent body, a sight that
fairly stunned them by its Oriental magnificence.&nbsp; It was
the four thousandth anniversary of the birth of Yeong Wo, had the
children realised it (and that may have been the reason that they
awoke in a fever of excitement)&mdash;Yeong Wo, statesman,
philanthropist, philosopher, and poet; and the great day had been
chosen to dedicate the new temple and install in it a new joss,
and to exhibit a monster dragon just arrived from China.&nbsp;
The joss had been sitting in solemn state in his sanctum
sanctorum for a week, while the priests appeased him hourly with
plenteous libations of rice brandy, sacrifices of snow-white
pigeons, and offerings of varnished pork.&nbsp; Clouds of incense
had regaled his expansive mahogany nostrils, while his ears of
ivory inlaid with gold and bronze had been stimulated with the
ceaseless clashing of gongs and wailings of Chinese
fiddles.&nbsp; Such homage and such worship would have touched a
heart of stone, and that of the joss was penetrable sandalwood;
so as the days of preparation wore away the smile on the teakwood
lips of the idol certainly became more propitious.&nbsp; This was
greatly to the satisfaction of the augurs and the high priest;
for a mighty joss is not always in a sunny humour on feast-days,
and to parade a sulky god through the streets is a very
depressing ceremony, foretelling to the initiated a season of
dire misfortune.&nbsp; So his godship smiled and shook his plume
of peacock feathers benignantly on Yeong Wo&rsquo;s birthday, and
therefore the pageant in which Atlantic and Pacific bore a part
was more gorgeous than anything that ever took place out of the
Flowery Kingdom itself.</p>
<p>Fortune smiled upon the naughty creatures at the very outset,
for Pacific picked up a stick of candy in the street, and gave
half of it to a pretty Chinese maiden whose name in English would
have been Spring Blossom, and who looked, in any language, like a
tropical flower, in her gown of blue-and-gold-embroidered satin
and the sheaf of tiny fans in her glossy black hair.&nbsp; Spring
Blossom accepted the gift with enthusiasm, since a sweet tooth is
not a matter of nationality, and ran immediately to tell her
mother, a childish instinct also of universal distribution.&nbsp;
She climbed, as nimbly as her queer little shoes would permit, a
flight of narrow steps leading to a balcony; while the twins
followed close at her heels, and wedged their way through a
forest of Mongolian legs till they reached the front, where they
peeped through the spaces of the railings with Spring Blossom,
Fairy Foot, Dewy Rose, and other Celestial babies, quite
overlooked in the crowd and excitement and jollity.&nbsp; Such a
very riot of confusion there was, it seemed as if Confucius might
have originally spelled his name with an s in the middle; for
every window was black with pigtailed highbinders, cobblers, pork
butchers, and pawnbrokers.&nbsp; The narrow streets and alleys
became one seething mass of Asiatic humanity; while the painted
belles came out on their balconies like butterflies, sitting
among a wealth of gaudy paper flowers that looked pale in
comparison with the daubs of vermilion on their cheeks and the
rainbow colours of their silken tunics.</p>
<p>At last the pageant had gathered itself together, and came
into full view in all its magnificence.&nbsp; There were pagodas
in teakwood inlaid with gold; and resting on ebony poles, and
behind them, on a very tame Rosinante decked with leopard skins
and gold bullion fringes, a Chinese maiden dressed to represent a
queen of Celestial mythology.&nbsp; Then came more pagodas, and
companies of standard-bearers in lavender tunics, red sashes,
green and orange leggings and slippers; more and more splendid
banners, painted with dragons sprawling in distressed attitudes;
litters containing minor gods and the paraphernalia they were
accustomed to need on a journey like this; more litters bearing
Chinese orchestras, gongs going at full blast, fiddles squeaking,
drums rumbling, trumpets shrieking, cymbals clashing,&mdash;just
the sort of Babel that the twins adored.</p>
<p>And now came the chariot and throne of the great joss himself,
and just behind him a riderless bay horse, intended for his
imperial convenience should he tire of being swayed about on the
shoulders of his twelve bearers, and elect to change his method
of conveyance.&nbsp; Behind this honoured steed came a mammoth
rock-cod in a pagoda of his own, and then, heralded by a fusilade
of fire-crackers, the new dragon itself, stretching and wriggling
its monster length through one entire block.&nbsp; A swarm of men
cleared the way for it, gesticulating like madmen in their zeal
to get swimming-room for the sacred monster.&nbsp; Never before
in her brief existence had Pacific Simonson been afraid of
anything, but if she had been in the street, and had so much as
caught the wink of the dragon&rsquo;s eye, or a wave of its
consecrated fin, she would have dropped senseless to the earth;
as it was, she turned her back to the procession, and, embracing
with terror-stricken fervour the legs of the Chinaman standing
behind her, made up her mind to be a better girl in the
future.&nbsp; The monster was borne by seventy-four coolies who
furnished legs for each of the seventy-four joints of its body,
while another concealed in its head tossed it wildly about.&nbsp;
Little pigtailed boys shrieked as they looked at its gaping mouth
that would have shamed a man-eating shark, at the huge locomotive
headlights that served for its various sets of eyes, at the horns
made of barber poles, and the moustache of twisted hogshead
hoops.&nbsp; Behind this baleful creature came other smaller
ones, and more flags, and litters with sacrificial offerings, and
more musicians, till all disappeared in the distance, and the
crowd surged in the direction of the temple.</p>
<p>There was no such good fortune for the twins as an entrance
into this holy of holies, for it held comparatively few besides
the dignitaries, aristocrats, and wealthy merchants of the
colony; but there was still ample material for entertainment, and
they paid no heed to the going down of the sun.&nbsp; Why should
they, indeed, when there were fascinating opium dens standing
hospitably open, where they could have the excitement of entrance
even if it were followed by immediate ejectment?&nbsp; As it grew
darker, the scene grew more weird and fairylike, for the scarlet,
orange, and blue lanterns began to gleam one by one in the narrow
doorways, and from the shadowy corners of the rooms behind
them.&nbsp; In every shop were tables laden with Chinese
delicacies,&mdash;fish, flesh, fowl, tea, rice, whisky, lichee
nuts, preserved limes, ginger, and other sweetmeats; all of
which, when not proffered, could be easily purloined, for there
was no spirit of parsimony or hostility afloat in the air.&nbsp;
In cubby-holes back of the counters, behind the stoves, wherever
they could find room for a table, groups of moon-eyed men began
to congregate for their nightly game of fan-tan, some of the
players and onlookers smoking, while others chewed lengths of
peeled sugar-cane.</p>
<p>In the midst of festivities like these the twins would have
gone on from bliss to bliss without consciousness of time or
place, had not hunger suddenly descended upon them and sleep
begun to tug at their eyelids, changing in a trice their joy into
sorrow and their mirth into mourning.&nbsp; Not that they were
troubled with any doubts, fears, or perplexities.&nbsp; True,
they had wandered away from Eden Place, and had not the slightest
idea of their whereabouts.&nbsp; If they had been a couple of
babes in a wood, or any two respectable lost children of romance,
memories of lullabies and prayers at mother&rsquo;s knee would
have precipitated them at this juncture into floods of tears; but
home to them was simply supper and bed.&nbsp; The situation did
not seem complex to their minds; the only plan was, of course, to
howl, and to do it thoroughly,&mdash;stand in a corner of the
market-place, and howl in such a manner that there could be no
mistake as to the significance of the proceeding; when the crowd
collected,&mdash;for naturally a crowd would
collect,&mdash;simply demand supper and bed, no matter what
supper nor which bed; eat the first, lie down in the second, and
there you are!&nbsp; If the twins had been older and more
experienced, they would have known that people occasionally do
demand the necessities of life without receiving them; but in
that case they would also have known that such a misfortune would
never fall upon a couple of lost children who confide their woes
to the public.&nbsp; There was no preconcerted plan between them,
no system.&nbsp; They acted without invention, premonition, or
reflection.&nbsp; It was their habit to scream, while holding the
breath as long as possible, whenever the universe was unfriendly,
and particularly when Nature asserted herself in any way; it was
a curious fact that they resented the intervention of Nature and
Providence with just as much energy as they did the discipline of
their caretakers.&nbsp; They screamed now, the moment that the
entertainment palled and they could not keep their eyes open
without effort; and never had they been more successful in
holding their breath and growing black in the face; indeed,
Pacific, in the midst of her performance, said to Atlantic,
&lsquo;Yours is purple, how is mine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A crowd did gather, inevitably, for the twins&rsquo; lungs
were capable of a body of tone more piercing than that of a
Chinese orchestra, and the wonder is that poor Lisa did not hear
them as she sat shivering on the curbstone, miles away; for it
was her name with which they conjured.</p>
<p>The populace amused itself for a short space of time, watching
the fine but misdirected zeal of the performance, and supposing
that the parents of the chanting cherubs were within easy
reach.&nbsp; It became unpleasant after a while, however, and a
policeman, inquiring into the matter, marched the two dirty,
weary little protestants off to a station near by,&mdash;a march
nearly as difficult and bloody as Sherman&rsquo;s memorable
&lsquo;march to the sea&rsquo;; for the children associated
nothing so pleasant as supper and bed with a blue-coated,
brass-buttoned person, and resisted his well-meant advances with
might and main, and tooth and nail.</p>
<p>The policeman was at last obliged to confine himself to
Atlantic, and called a brother-in-arms to take charge of
Pacific.&nbsp; He was a man who had achieved distinction in
putting down railroad riots, so he was well calculated for the
task, although he was somewhat embarrassed by the laughter of the
bystanders when his comrade called out to him, &lsquo;Take your
club, Mike, but don&rsquo;t use firearms unless your life&rsquo;s
in danger!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The station reached, the usual examination took place.&nbsp;
Atlantic never could tell the name of the street in which he
lived, nor the number of the house.&nbsp; Pacific could, perhaps,
but would not; and it must be said, in apology for her abnormal
defiance, that her mental operations were somewhat confused,
owing to copious indulgence in strong tea, ginger, sugar-cane,
and dried fish.&nbsp; She had not been wisely approached in the
first place, and she was in her sulkiest and most combative
humour; in fact, when too urgently pressed for information as to
her age, ancestry, and abiding-place, she told the worthy
police-officer to go to a locality for which he felt utterly
unsuited, after a life spent in the exaltation of virtue and the
suppression of vice.&nbsp; (The vocabulary of the twins was
somewhat poverty-stricken in respect to the polite phrases of
society, but in profanity it would have been rich for a parrot or
a pirate.)&nbsp; The waifs were presently given to the care of
the police matron, and her advice, sought later, was to the
effect that the children had better be fed and put to bed, and as
little trouble expended upon them as was consistent with a
Christian city government.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is possible their parents may call for them in the
morning,&rsquo; she said acidly, &lsquo;but I think it is more
than likely that they have been deserted.&nbsp; I know if they
belonged to me they&rsquo;d be lost for ever before I tried to
find them!&rsquo; and she rubbed a black-and-blue spot on her
person, which, if exposed, would have betrayed the shape, size,
and general ground-plan of Pacific&rsquo;s boot.</p>

150</span>XI<br />
RHODA FREES HER MIND</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Morning</span> dawned, and Mistress Mary
and Rhoda went up the flight of broad steps rather earlier than
usual,&mdash;so early that the janitress, who had been awake half
the night with an ailing baby, was just going in to dust the
rooms.</p>
<p>It was she who first caught sight of the old sofa and its
occupant, and her exclamation drew Mary and Rhoda to the
spot.&nbsp; There lay poor Marm Lisa in the dead sleep of
exhaustion, her dress torn and wrinkled, her shoes
travel-stained, her hair tangled and matted.&nbsp; Their first
idea was that the dreaded foe might have descended upon her, and
that she had had some terrible seizure with no one near to aid
and relieve her.&nbsp; But the longer they looked, the less they
feared this; her face, though white and tear-stained, was
tranquil, her lips only slightly pale, and her breathing calm and
steady.&nbsp; Mary finally noted the pathetic grouping of little
objects in the red chair, and, touched by this, began to
apprehend the significance of her own white apron close clasped
in the child&rsquo;s loyal arms, and fell a-weeping softly on
Rhoda&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; &lsquo;She needed me, Rhoda,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not know for what, but I am sure she
needed me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see it all,&rsquo; said Rhoda, administering soft
strokes of consolation: &lsquo;it is something to do with those
little beasts; yes, I will call them beasts, and if you
don&rsquo;t let me, I&rsquo;ll call them brutes.&nbsp; They lost
themselves yesterday, of course, and dear old Lisa searched for
them all the afternoon and half the night, for aught we know, and
then came here to be comforted, I suppose&mdash;the blessed
thing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush! don&rsquo;t touch her,&rsquo; Mary whispered, as
Rhoda went impetuously down on her knees by the sofa; &lsquo;and
we must not talk in this room, for fear of waking her.&nbsp;
Suppose you go at once to Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s, dear, and, whatever
you learn about the twins there, I shall meanwhile call a
carriage and take Lisa home to my own bed.&nbsp; The janitress
can send Edith to me as soon as she comes, and I will leave her
with Lisa while I run back here to consult with you and
Helen.&nbsp; I shall telegraph for Dr. Thorne, also, to be sure
that this sleep is as natural and healing a thing as it appears
to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Grubb was surprised, even amused, at Rhoda&rsquo;s
exciting piece of news, but she was perfectly tranquil.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, don&rsquo;t they beat all!&rsquo; she exclaimed,
leaning against the door-frame and taking her side hair out of
waving-pins as she talked.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t seen
them since noon yesterday.&nbsp; I was out to a picnic supper at
the Army Headquarters at night, and didn&rsquo;t get home till
later than usual, so I didn&rsquo;t go up to their room.&nbsp; I
thought they were in bed; they always have been in bed when it
was bedtime, ever since they were born.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here she
removed the last pin, and put it with the others in the bosom of
her dress for safe-keeping.&nbsp; &lsquo;This morning, when they
didn&rsquo;t turn up, I thought some of you girls had taken a
fancy to keep them overnight; I didn&rsquo;t worry, supposing
that Lisa was with them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody on earth could take a fancy to the twins or keep
them an hour longer than necessary, and you know it, Mrs.
Grubb,&rsquo; said Rhoda, who seldom minced matters; &lsquo;and
in case no one should ever have the bad manners to tell you the
whole truth, I want to say here and now that you neglect
everything good and sensible and practical,&mdash;all the plain,
simple duties that stare you directly in the face,&mdash;and
waste yourself on matters that are of no earthly use to
anybody.&nbsp; Those children would have been missed last night
if you had one drop of mother&rsquo;s blood in your veins!&nbsp;
You have three helpless children under what you are pleased to
call your care&rsquo; (and here Rhoda&rsquo;s lip curled so
scornfully that Mrs. Grubb was tempted to stab her with a
curling-pin), &lsquo;and you went to sleep without knowing to a
certainty whether they had had supper or bed!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
believe you are a woman at all&mdash;you are just a vague
abstraction; and the only things you&rsquo;ve ever borne or
nursed or brooded in your life have been your miserable,
bloodless little clubs and bands and unions!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda&rsquo;s eyes flashed summer lightning, her nostrils
quivered, her cheeks flamed scarlet, and Mrs. Grubb sat down
suddenly and heavily on the front stairs and gasped for
breath.&nbsp; According to her own belief, her whole life had
been passed in a search for truth, but it is safe to say she had
never before met it in so uncompromising and disagreeable a
shape.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps when you are quite through with your
billingsgate,&rsquo; she finally said, &lsquo;you will take
yourself off my steps before you are ejected.&nbsp; You! to
presume to criticise me!&nbsp; You, that are so low in the scale
of being, you can no more understand my feelings and motives than
a jellyfish can comprehend a star!&nbsp; Go back and tell Miss
Mary,&rsquo; she went on majestically, as she gained confidence
and breath, &lsquo;that it is her duty and business to find the
children, since they were last seen with her, and unless she
proves more trustworthy they will not be allowed to return to
her.&nbsp; Tell her, too, that when she wishes to communicate
with me, she must choose some other messenger besides you, you
impudent, grovelling little earthworm!&nbsp; Get out of my sight,
or you will unfit me for my classes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Grubb was fairly superb as she launched these
thunderbolts of invective; the staircase her rostrum, her left
hand poised impressively on the baluster, and the three snaky
strands of brown hair that had writhed out of the waving-pins
hissing Medusa-wise on each side of her bead.</p>
<p>Rhoda was considerably taken aback by the sudden and violent
slamming of the door of No. 1 Eden Place, and she felt an
unwelcome misgiving as to her wisdom in bringing Mrs. Grubb face
to face with truth.&nbsp; Her rage had somewhat subsided by the
time she reached Mistress Mary&rsquo;s side, for she had stopped
on the way to ask a policeman to telephone the various stations
for news of the lost children, and report at once to her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is one good thing,&rsquo; she thought:
&lsquo;wherever they may be, their light cannot be hid any more
than that of a city that is set on a hill.&nbsp; There will be
plenty of traces of their journey, for once seen they are never
forgotten.&nbsp; Nobody but a hero would think of kidnapping
them, and nobody but an idiot would expect a ransom for
them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t upbraid Mrs. Grubb,&rsquo; said
Mary, divining from Rhoda&rsquo;s clouded brow that her interview
had not been a pleasant one.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know our only
peaceful way of rescuing Lisa from her hold is to make a friend
of her, and convert her to our way of thinking.&nbsp; Was she
much disturbed about the children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Disturbed!&rsquo; sniffed Rhoda disdainfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Imagine Mrs. Grubb disturbed about anything so trivial as
a lost child!&nbsp; If it had been a lost amendment, she might
have been ruffled!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is she doing about it, and in what direction is
she searching?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is doing nothing, and she will do nothing; she has
gone to a Theosophy lecture, and we are to find the twins; and
she says it&rsquo;s your fault, anyway, and unless you prove more
trustworthy the seraphs will be removed from your care; and you
are not to send me again as a messenger, if you please, because I
am an impudent, grovelling little earthworm!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rhoda!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&rsquo;m!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did she call you that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&rsquo;m, and a jellyfish besides; in fact, she
dragged me through the entire animal kingdom; but she is a
stellar being&mdash;she said so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did you say to her to provoke that, Rhoda?&nbsp;
She is thoroughly illogical and perverse, but she is very
amiable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, when you don&rsquo;t interfere with her.&nbsp; You
should catch her with her hair in waving-pins, just after she has
imbibed apple-sauce!&nbsp; Oh, I can&rsquo;t remember exactly
what I said, for I confess I was a trifle heated, and at the
moment I thought only of freeing my mind.&nbsp; Let me see: I
told her she neglected all the practical duties that stared her
directly in the face, and squandered herself on useless fads and
vagaries&mdash;that&rsquo;s about all.&nbsp; No-o, now that I
come to think of it, I did say that the children would have been
missed and found last night, if she had had a drop of
mother&rsquo;s blood in her veins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s terse and strong&mdash;and tactful,&rsquo;
said Mary; &lsquo;anything more?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so.&nbsp; Oh yes! now that I
reflect, I said I didn&rsquo;t believe she was a woman at
all.&nbsp; That seemed to enrage her beyond anything, somehow;
and when I explained it, and tried to modify it by saying I meant
that she had never borne or loved or brooded anything in her life
but her nasty little clubs, she was white with anger, and told me
I was too low in the scale of being to understand her.&nbsp; Good
gracious!&nbsp; I wish she understood herself half as well as I
understand her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary gave a hysterical laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
pretend you didn&rsquo;t speak the truth, Rhoda, but I am sadly
afraid it was ill advised to wound Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s
vanity.&nbsp; Do you feel a good deal better?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; confessed Rhoda penitently.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
did for fifteen minutes,&mdash;yes, nearly half an hour; but now
I feel worse than ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is one of the commonest symptoms of freeing
one&rsquo;s mind,&rsquo; observed Mary quietly.</p>
<p>It was scarcely an hour later when Atlantic and Pacific were
brought in by an officer, very dirty and dishevelled, but gay and
irresponsible as larks, nonchalant, amiable, and
unrepentant.&nbsp; As Rhoda had prophesied, there had been no
difficulty in finding them; and as everybody had prophesied, once
found there had not been a second&rsquo;s delay in
delivery.&nbsp; Moved by fiery hatred of the police matron, who
had illustrated justice more than mercy, and illustrated it with
the back of a hair-brush on their reversed persons; lured also by
two popcorn balls, a jumping-jack, and a tin horse, they accepted
the municipal escort with alacrity; and nothing was ever jauntier
than the manner in which Pacific, all smiles and molasses, held
up her sticky lips for an expected salute&mdash;an unusual offer
which was respectfully declined as a matter of discipline.</p>
<p>Mary longed for Rhoda&rsquo;s young minister in the next
half-hour, which she devoted to private spiritual
instruction.&nbsp; Psychology proved wholly unequal to the task
of fathoming the twins, and she fancied that theology might have
been more helpful.&nbsp; Their idea seemed to be&mdash;if the
rudimentary thing she unearthed from their consciousness could be
called an idea&mdash;that they would not mind repenting if they
could see anything of which to repent.&nbsp; Of sin, as sin, they
had no apparent knowledge, either by sight, by hearsay or by
actual acquaintance.&nbsp; They sat stolidly in their little
chairs, eyes roving to the windows, the blackboard, the pictures;
they clubbed together and fished a pin from a crack in the floor
during one of Mary&rsquo;s most thrilling appeals; finally they
appeared so bored by the whole proceeding that she felt a certain
sense of embarrassment in the midst of her despair.&nbsp; She
took them home herself at noon, apologised to the injured Mrs.
Grubb for Rhoda&rsquo;s unfortunate remarks, and told that lady,
gently but firmly, that Lisa could not be moved until she was
decidedly better.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was wandering about the streets searching for the
twins from noon till long after dark, Mrs. Grubb&mdash;there can
be no doubt of it; and she bears unmistakable signs of having
suffered deeply.&nbsp; I have called in a physician, and we must
all abide by his advice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s well enough for the present,&rsquo; agreed
Mrs. Grubb reluctantly, &lsquo;but I cannot continue to have my
studies broken in upon by these excitements.&nbsp; I really
cannot.&nbsp; I thought I had made an arrangement with Madame
Goldmarker to relieve me, but she has just served me a most
unladylike and deceitful trick, and the outcome of it will be
that I shall have to send Lisa to the asylum.&nbsp; I can get her
examined by the commissioners some time before Christmas, and if
they decide she&rsquo;s imbecile they&rsquo;ll take her off my
hands.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to part with her till the twins
got older, but I&rsquo;ve just found a possible home for them if
I can endure their actions until New Year&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Our Army
of Present Perfection isn&rsquo;t progressing as it ought to, and
it&rsquo;s going to found a colony down in San Diego County, and
advertise for children to bring up in the faith.&nbsp; A certain
number of men and women have agreed to go and start the thing and
I&rsquo;m sure my sister, if she was alive would be glad to
donate her children to such a splendid enterprise.&nbsp; If the
commissioners won&rsquo;t take Lisa, she can go to Soul Haven,
too&mdash;that&rsquo;s the name of the place;&mdash;but no, of
course they wouldn&rsquo;t want any but bright children, that
would grow up and spread the light.&rsquo; (Mary smiled at the
thought of the twins engaged in the occupation of spreading
light.)&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall not join the community myself,
though I believe it&rsquo;s a good thing; but a very different
future is unveiling itself before me&rsquo; (her tone was full of
mystery here), &lsquo;and some time, if I can ever pursue my
investigations in peace, you will knock at this door and I shall
have vanished!&nbsp; But I shall know of your visit, and the very
sound of your footfall will reach my ear, even if I am inhabiting
some remote mountain fastness!&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>When Lisa awoke that night, she heard the crackling of a wood
fire on the hearth; she felt the touch of soft linen under her
aching body, and the pressure of something cool and fragrant on
her forehead.&nbsp; Her right hand, feebly groping the white
counterpane, felt a flower in its grasp.&nbsp; Opening her eyes,
she saw the firelight dancing on tinted walls, and an angel of
deliverance sitting by her bedside&mdash;a dear familiar woman
angel, whose fair crowned head rose from a cloud of white, and
whose sweet downward gaze held all of benignant motherhood that
God could put into woman&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Marm Lisa looked up dumbly and wonderingly at first, but the
mind stirred, thought flowed in upon it, a wave of pain broke
over her heart, and she remembered all; for remembrance, alas, is
the price of reason.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lost! my twinnies, all lost and gone!&rsquo; she
whispered brokenly, with long, shuddering sobs between the
words.&nbsp; &lsquo;I look&mdash;look&mdash;look; never, never
find!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, dear,&rsquo; Mary answered, stroking the lines
from her forehead, &lsquo;not lost any more; found, Lisa&mdash;do
you understand?&nbsp; They are found, they are safe and well, and
nobody blames you; and you are safe, too, your new self, your
best self unharmed, thank God; so go to sleep, little sister, and
dream happy dreams!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Glad tears rushed from the poor child&rsquo;s eyes, tears of
conscious happiness, and the burden rolled away from her heart
now, as yesterday&rsquo;s whirring shuttles in her brain had been
hushed into silence by her long sleep.&nbsp; She raised her
swimming eyes to Mistress Mary&rsquo;s with a look of unspeakable
trust.&nbsp; &lsquo;I love you! oh, I love, love, love
you!&rsquo; she whispered, and, holding the flower close to her
breast, she breathed a sigh of sweet content, and sank again into
quiet slumber.</p>
<h2><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>XII<br />
FLOTSAM AND JETSAM</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may be said in justice to Mrs.
Grubb that she was more than usually harassed just at this
time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sylvester, her voluble next-door neighbour, who had
lifted many sordid cares from her shoulders, had suddenly become
tired of the &lsquo;new method of mental healing,&rsquo; and
during a brief absence of Mrs. Grubb from the city had issued a
thousand embossed gilt-edged cards, announcing herself as the
Hand Reader in the following terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TO THE ELITE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE
CITY!</span></p>
<p>I take this method of introducing myself to your kind
consideration as a Hand Reader of <i>rare</i> and <i>genuine
merit</i>; catering merely to the Creme du le Creme of this
city.&nbsp; No others need apply.</p>
<p>Having been educated carefully and refinedly, speaking French
fluently, therefore I only wish to deal with the elite of the
bon-ton.</p>
<p>I do not advertise in papers nor at residence.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Ladies $1.50.&nbsp; Gents $2.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pansy
Sylvester</span>,<br />
3 Eden Place near 4th,<br />
Lower bell</p>
<p><i>P.S.</i>&nbsp; Pupil of S. <span class="smcap">Cora
Grubb</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inasmuch as Mrs. Sylvester had imbibed all her knowledge from
Mrs. Grubb, that prophet and scholar thought, not unnaturally,
that she might have been consulted about the enterprise,
particularly as the cards were of a nature to prejudice the
better class of patients, and lower the social tone of the temple
of healing.</p>
<p>As if this were not vexatious enough, her plans were
disarranged in another and more important particular.&nbsp; Mrs.
Sylvester&rsquo;s manicure had set up a small establishment for
herself, and admitted as partner a certain chiropodist named
Boone.&nbsp; The two artists felt that by sharing expenses they
might increase profits, and there was a sleeping thought in both
their minds that the partnership might ripen into marriage if the
financial returns of the business were satisfactory.&nbsp; It was
destined, however, to be a failure in both respects; for Dr.
Boone looked upon Madame Goldmarker, the vocal teacher in No. 13
Eden Place, and to look upon her was to love her madly, since she
earned seventy-five dollars a month, while the little manicure
could barely eke out a slender and uncertain twenty.&nbsp; In
such crises the heart can be trusted to leap in the right
direction and beat at the proper rate.</p>
<p>Mrs. Grubb would have had small interest in these sordid
romances had it not been that Madame Goldmarker had faithfully
promised to look after Lisa and the twins, so that Mrs. Grubb
might be free to hold classes in the adjoining towns.&nbsp; The
little blind god had now overturned all these well-laid plans,
and Mrs. Grubb was for the moment the victim of inexorable
circumstances.</p>
<p>Dr. Boone fitted up princely apartments next his office, and
Madame Goldmarker Boone celebrated her nuptials and her desertion
of Eden Place by making a formal <i>d&eacute;but</i> at a concert
in Pocahontas Hall.&nbsp; The next morning, the neighbourhood
that knew them best, and many other neighbourhoods that knew them
not at all, received neat printed circulars thrust under the
front door.&nbsp; Upon one side of the paper were printed the
words and music of &lsquo;Home, Sweet Home,&rsquo; &lsquo;as sung
by Madame Goldmarker Boone at her late concert in Pocahontas
Hall.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the reverse side appeared a picture of the
doctor, a neat cut of a human foot, a schedule of prices, and the
alluring promise that the Madame&rsquo;s vocal pupils would
receive treatment at half the regular rates.</p>
<p>Many small disputes and quarrels were consequent upon these
business, emotional, and social convulsions, and each of the
parties concerned, from Mrs. Grubb to the chiropodist, consulted
Mistress Mary and solicited her advice and interference.</p>
<p>This seemed a little strange, but Mistress Mary&rsquo;s garden
was the sort of place to act as a magnet to reformers,
eccentrics, professional philanthropists, and cranks.&nbsp; She
never quite understood the reason, and for that matter nobody
else did, unless it were simply that the place was a trifle out
of the common, and she herself a person full of ideas, and
eminently sympathetic with those of other people.&nbsp; Anybody
could &lsquo;drop in,&rsquo; and as a consequence everybody
did&mdash;grandmothers, mothers with babes in arms, teachers,
ministers, photographers, travellers, and journalists.&nbsp; A
Russian gentleman who had escaped from Siberia was a frequent
visitor.&nbsp; He wanted to marry Edith and open a boarding-house
for Russian exiles, and was perfectly confident of making her
happy, as he spoke seven languages and had been a good husband to
two Russian ladies now deceased.&nbsp; An Alaskan missionary,
home on a short leave, called periodically, and attempted to
persuade Mary to return with him to his heathen.&nbsp; These
suitors were disposed of summarily when they made their desires
known; but there were other visitors, part of the flotsam and
jetsam of a great city, who appeared and disappeared
mysteriously&mdash;ships passing Mistress Mary in the night of
sorrow, and, after some despairing, half-comprehended signal,
vanishing into the shadows out of which they had come.&nbsp;
Sometimes, indeed, inspired by the good cheer of the place, they
departed, looking a little less gloomy; sometimes, too, they grew
into a kind of active if transitory relation with the busy little
world, and became, for a time, a part of it.</p>
<p>Mistress Mary went down to the street corner with the children
one noon to see them safely over the crossing.&nbsp; There was
generally a genial policeman who made it a part of his duty to
stand guard there, and guide the reckless and stupid and
bewildered ones among the youngsters over the difficulties that
lay in their path.&nbsp; Sometimes he would devote himself
exclusively to Atlantic and Pacific Simonson, who really desired
death, though they were not spiritually fitted for it, and bent
all their energies towards getting under trucks rather than away
from them.&nbsp; Marm Lisa never approached the spot without a
nervous trembling and a look of terror in her eyes, and before
the advent of the helpful officer had always taken a twin by each
arm, and the three had gone over thus as a solid body, no matter
how strong the resistance.</p>
<p>On this special morning there was no guardian of the peace in
evidence, but standing on the crossing was a bearded man of
perhaps forty years.&nbsp; Rather handsome he was, and well
though carelessly dressed, but he stood irresolutely with his
hands in his pockets, as if quite undecided what to do
next.&nbsp; Mary simply noted him as an altogether strange figure
in the neighbourhood, but the unexpected appearance of a large
dog on the scene scattered the babies, and they fell on her in a
weeping phalanx.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you kindly help a little?&rsquo; she asked after a
moment&rsquo;s waiting, in which any chivalrous gentleman, she
thought, should have flung himself into the breach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I?&rsquo; he asked vaguely.&nbsp; &lsquo;How do you
mean?&nbsp; What shall I do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She longed to say, &lsquo;Wake up, and perhaps an idea will
come to you&rsquo;; but she did say, with some spirit,
&lsquo;Almost anything, thank you.&nbsp; Drive the dog away, and
help some of the smallest children across the street,
please.&nbsp; You can have these two&rsquo; (indicating the twins
smilingly), &lsquo;or the other ninety-eight&mdash;whichever you
like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed orders, though not in a very alert fashion, but
showed a sense of humour in choosing the ninety-eight rather than
the two, and Mary left him on the corner with a pleasant word of
thanks and a cheery remark.</p>
<p>The next morning he appeared at the garden gate, and asked if
he might come in and sit a while.&nbsp; He was made welcome; but
it was a busy morning, and he was so silent a visitor that
everybody forgot his existence.</p>
<p>He made a curious impression, which can hardly be described,
save that any student of human nature would say at once,
&lsquo;He is out of relation with the world.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had
something of the expression one sees in a recluse or a
hermit.&nbsp; If you have ever wandered up a mountain side, you
may have come suddenly upon a hut, a rude bed within it, and in
the door a man reading, or smoking, or gazing into vacancy.&nbsp;
You remember the look you met in that man&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; He
has tasted life and found it bitter; has sounded the world and
found it hollow; has known man or woman and found them
false.&nbsp; Friendship to him is without savour, and love
without hope.</p>
<p>After watching the children for an hour, the stranger slipped
out quietly.&nbsp; Mistress Mary followed him to the door,
abashed at her unintentional discourtesy in allowing him to go
without a good morning.&nbsp; She saw him stand at the foot of
the steps, look first up, then down the street, then walk
aimlessly to the corner.&nbsp; There, with hands in pockets, he
paused again, glancing four ways; then, with a shrug and a gait
that seemed to say, &lsquo;It makes no difference,&rsquo; he
slouched away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is simply a stranger in a strange city, pining for
his home,&rsquo; thought Mary, &lsquo;or else he is a stranger in
every city, and has nowhere a home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He came again a few days later, and then again, apologising
for the frequency of his visits, but giving no special reason for
them.&nbsp; The neophytes called him &lsquo;the Solitary,&rsquo;
but the children christened him after a fashion of their own, and
began to ask small favours of him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thread my needle,
please, Mr. Man!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;More beads,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;More paper, Mr. Man, please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is impossible to keep out of relation with little
children.&nbsp; One of these mites of humanity would make a man
out of your mountain hermit, resist as he might.&nbsp; They set
up a claim on one whether it exists or not, and one has to allow
it, and respond to it at least in some perfunctory fashion.&nbsp;
More than once, as Mr. Man sat silently near the circle, the
chubby Baker baby would fall over his feet, and he would
involuntarily stoop to pick her up, straighten her dress, and
soothe her woe.&nbsp; There was no hearty pleasure in his service
even now.&nbsp; Nobody was certain that he felt any pleasure at
all.&nbsp; His helpfulness was not spontaneous; it seemed a kind
of reflex action, a survival of some former state of mind or
heart; for he did his favours in a dream, nor heard any thanks:
yet the elixir was working in his veins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is dreadfully in the way,&rsquo; grumbled Edith;
&lsquo;he is more ever-present than my ardent Russian.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So long as he insists on coming, let us make him supply
the paternal element,&rsquo; suggested Rhoda.&nbsp; &lsquo;It may
be a degrading confession, but we could afford to part with
several women here if we could only secure a really fatherly
man.&nbsp; The Solitary cannot indulge in any day-dreams or
trances, if we accept him as the patriarch of the
institution.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon they boldly asked him, on his subsequent visits, to
go upon errands, and open barrels of apples, and order
intoxicated gentlemen off the steps, and mend locks and
window-fastenings, and sharpen lead-pencils, and put on coal, and
tell the lady in the rear that her parrot interfered with their
morning prayers by shrieking the hymns in impossible keys.&nbsp;
He accepted these tasks without protest, and performed them
conscientiously, save in the parrot difficulty, in which case he
gave one look at the lady, and fled without opening the
subject.</p>
<p>It could not be said that he appeared more cheerful, the sole
sign of any increased exhilaration of spirits being the
occasional straightening of his cravat and the smoothing of his
hair&mdash;refinements of toilet that had heretofore been much
neglected, though he always looked unmistakably the
gentleman.</p>
<p>He seemed more attracted by Lisa than by any of the smaller
children; but that may have been because Mary had told him her
story, thinking that other people&rsquo;s stories were a useful
sort of thing to tell people who had possible stories of their
own.</p>
<p>Lisa was now developing a curious and unexpected facility and
talent in the musical games.&nbsp; She played the tambourine, the
triangle, the drum, as nobody else could, and in accompanying the
marches she invented all sorts of unusual beats and
accents.&nbsp; It grew to be the natural thing to give her
difficult parts in the little dramas of child life: the cock that
crowed in the morn to wake the sleeping birds and babies, the
mother-bird in the nest, the spreading willow-tree in the pond
where the frogs congregated,&mdash;these <i>r&ocirc;les</i> she
delighted in and played with all her soul.</p>
<p>It would have been laughable, had it not been pathetic, to
watch her drag Mr. Man into the games, and to see him succumb to
her persuasions with his face hanging out flaming signals of
embarrassment.&nbsp; In the &lsquo;Carrier Doves&rsquo; the
little pigeons flew with an imaginary letter to him, and this
meant that he was to stand and read it aloud, as Mary and Edith
had done before him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems to be a letter from a child,&rsquo; he
faltered, and then began stammeringly, &lsquo;&ldquo;My dear Mr.
Man&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;there was a sudden stop.&nbsp; That there
was a letter in his mind nobody could doubt, but he was too
greatly moved to read it.&nbsp; Rhoda quickly reached out her
hand for the paper, covering his discomfiture by exclaiming,
&lsquo;The pigeons have brought Mr. Man a letter from some
children in his fatherland!&nbsp; Yes&rsquo; (reading),
&lsquo;they hope that we will be good to him, because he is far
away from home, and they send their love to all Mistress
Mary&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t it pretty of the doves
to remember that Mr. Man is a stranger here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Solitary appeared for the last time a week before
Thanksgiving Day, and he opened the door on a scene of jollity
that warmed him to the heart.</p>
<p>In the middle of the floor was a mimic boat, crowded from stem
to stern with little Pilgrim fathers and mothers trying to land
on Plymouth Rock, in a high state of excitement and an equally
high sea.&nbsp; Pat Higgins was a chieftain commanding a large
force of tolerably peaceful Indians on the shore, and Massasoit
himself never exhibited more dignity; while Marm Lisa was the
proud mother of the baby Oceanus born on the eventful voyage of
the <i>Mayflower</i>.</p>
<p>Then Mistress Mary told the story of the festival very simply
and sweetly, and all the tiny Pilgrims sang a hymn of
thanksgiving.&nbsp; The Solitary listened, with his heart in his
eyes and a sob in his throat; then, Heaven knows under the
inspiration of what memory, he brushed Edith from the
piano-stool, and, seating himself in her place, played as if he
were impelled by some irresistible force.&nbsp; The hand of a
master had never swept those keys before, and he held his hearers
spellbound.</p>
<p>There was a silence that could be felt.&nbsp; The major part
of the audience were not of an age to appreciate high art, but
the youngsters were awed by the strange spectacle of Mr. Man at
the piano, and with gaping mouth and strained ear listened to the
divine harmonies he evoked.&nbsp; On and on he played, weaving
the story of his past into the music, so it seemed to Mistress
Mary.&nbsp; The theme came brokenly and uncertainly at first, as
his thoughts strove for expression.&nbsp; Then out of the
bitterness and gall, the suffering and the struggle&mdash;and was
it remorse?&mdash;was born a sweet, resolute, triumphant strain
that carried the listeners from height to height of sympathy and
emotion.&nbsp; It had not a hint of serenity; it was new-born
courage, aspiration, and self-mastery the song of &lsquo;him that
overcometh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When he paused, there was a deep-drawn breath, a sigh from
hearts surcharged with feeling, and Lisa, who had drawn closer
and closer to the piano, stood there now, one hand leaning on Mr.
Man&rsquo;s shoulder and the tears chasing one another down her
cheeks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It hurts me here,&rsquo; she sighed, pressing her hand
to her heart.</p>
<p>He rose presently and left the room without a word, while the
children prepared for home-going with a subdued air of having
assisted at some solemn rite.</p>
<p>When Mistress Mary went out on the steps, a little later, he
was still there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the last time!&nbsp; Auf wiedersehen!&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Auf wiedersehen,&rsquo; she answered gently, giving him
her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you no Thanksgiving sermon for me?&rsquo; he
asked, holding her fingers lingeringly.&nbsp; &lsquo;No child in
all your flock needs it so much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mary, her eyes falling, for a moment,
beneath his earnest gaze; but suddenly she lifted them again as
she said bravely, &lsquo;I have a sermon, but it is one with a
trumpet-call, and little balm in it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unto whomsoever
anything is given, of him something shall be
required.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>When he reached the corner of the street he stopped, but
instead of glancing four ways, as usual, he looked back at the
porch where Mistress Mary stood.&nbsp; She carried Jenny Baker, a
rosy sprig of babyhood, in the lovely curve of her arm; Bobby
Baxter clasped her neck from behind in a strangling embrace;
Johnny, and Meg, and Billy were tugging at her apron; and Marm
Lisa was standing on tiptoe trying to put a rose in her
hair.&nbsp; Then the Solitary passed into the crowd, and they saw
him in the old places no more.</p>

LEAVES FROM MISTRESS MARY&rsquo;S GARDEN</h2>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">We</span> have an unknown
benefactor.&nbsp; A fortnight ago came three bushels of flowers:
two hundred tiny nosegays marked &ldquo;For the children,&rdquo;
half a dozen knots of pink roses for the &ldquo;little
mothers,&rdquo; a dozen scarlet carnations for Lisa, while one
great bunch of white lilies bore the inscription, &ldquo;For the
Mother Superior.&rdquo;&nbsp; Last week a barrel of apples and
another of oranges appeared mysteriously, and to-day comes a
note, written in a hand we do not recognise, saying we are not to
buy holly, mistletoe, evergreens, Christmas tree, or baubles of
any kind, as they will be sent to us on December 22.&nbsp; We
have inquired of our friends, but have no clue as yet, further
than it must be somebody who knows our needs and desires very
thoroughly.&nbsp; We have certainly entertained an angel
unawares, but which among the crowd of visitors is it most likely
to be?&nbsp; The Solitary, I wonder?&nbsp; I should never have
thought it, were it not for the memory of that last day, the
scene at the piano, the &ldquo;song of him that
overcometh,&rdquo; and the backward glance from the corner as he
sprang, absolutely sprang, on the car.&nbsp; There was purpose in
it, or I am greatly mistaken.&nbsp; Mr. Man&rsquo;s eyes would be
worth looking into, if one could find purpose in their brown
depths!&nbsp; Moreover, though I am too notorious a dreamer of
dreams to be trusted, I cannot help fancying he went <i>back</i>
to something; it was not a mere forward move, not a sudden
determination to find some new duty to do that life might grow
nobler and sweeter, but a return to an old duty grown
hateful.&nbsp; That was what I saw in his face as he stood on the
crossing, with the noon sunshine caught in his tawny hair and
beard.&nbsp; Rhoda, Edith, and I have each made a story about
him, and each of us would vouch for the truth of her particular
version.&nbsp; I will not tell mine, but this is Rhoda&rsquo;s;
and while it differs from my own in several important
particulars, it yet bears an astonishing resemblance to it.&nbsp;
It is rather romantic, but if one is to make any sort of story
out of the Solitary it must be a romantic one, for he suggests no
other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rhoda began her tale with a thrilling introduction that
set us all laughing (we smile here when still the tears are close
at hand; indeed, we must smile, or we could not live): the
prelude being something about a lonely castle in the heart of the
Hartz Mountains, and a prattling golden-haired babe stretching
its arms across a ruined moat in the direction of its absent
father.&nbsp; This was in the nature of an absurd prologue, but
when she finally came to the Solitary she grew serious; for she
made him in the bygone days a sensitive child and a dreamy,
impetuous youth, with a domineering, ill-tempered father who was
utterly unable and unwilling to understand or to sympathise with
him.&nbsp; His younger brother (for Rhoda insists on a younger
brother) lived at home, while he, the elder, spent, or misspent,
his youth and early manhood in a German university.&nbsp; As the
years went on, the relations between himself and his father grew
more and more strained.&nbsp; Do as the son might, he could never
please, either in his line of thought and study or in his
practical pursuits.&nbsp; The father hated his books, his music,
his poetry, and his artist friends, while he on his part found
nothing to stimulate or content him in his father&rsquo;s tasks
and manner of life.&nbsp; His mother pined and died in the effort
to keep peace between them, but the younger brother&rsquo;s
schemes were quite in an opposite direction.&nbsp; At this time,
Mr. Man flung himself into a foolish marriage, one that promised
little in the shape of the happiness he craved so eagerly.&nbsp;
(Rhoda insists on this unhappy marriage; I am in doubt about
it.)&nbsp; Finally his father died, and on being summoned home,
as he supposed, to take his rightful place and assume the
management of the estate, he found himself disinherited.&nbsp; He
could have borne the loss of fortune and broad acres better than
this convincing proof of his father&rsquo;s dislike and distrust,
and he could have endured even that, had it not befallen him
through the perfidy of his brother.&nbsp; When, therefore, he was
met by his wife&rsquo;s bitter reproaches and persistent coldness
he closed his heart against all the world, shook the dust of home
from off his feet, left his own small fortune behind him, kissed
his little son, and became a wanderer on the face of the
earth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is substantially Rhoda&rsquo;s story, but it does
not satisfy her completely.&nbsp; She says, in her whimsical way,
that it needs another villain to account properly for Mr.
Man&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would it not be strange if by any chance we have
brought him to a happier frame of mind?&nbsp; Would it not be a
lovely tribute to the secret power of this place, to the healing
atmosphere of love that we try to create&mdash;that atmosphere in
which we bathe our own tired spirits day by day, recreating
ourselves with every new dawn?&nbsp; But whether our benefactor
be the Solitary or not, some heart has been brought into new
relation with us and with the world.&nbsp; It only confirms my
opinion that everybody is at his or her best in the presence of
children.&nbsp; In what does the magic of their influence
consist?&nbsp; This morning I was riding down in the horse-cars,
and a poor ragged Italian woman entered, a baby in her arms, and
two other children following close behind.&nbsp; The girl was a
mite of a thing, prematurely grave, serious, pretty, and she led
a boy just old enough to toddle.&nbsp; She lifted him carefully
up to the seat (she who should have been lifted herself!), took
his hat, smoothed his damp, curly hair, and tucked his head down
on her shoulder, a shoulder that had begun its life-work full
early, poor tot!&nbsp; The boy was a feeble, frail,
ill-nourished, dirty young urchin, who fell asleep as soon as his
head touched her arm.&nbsp; His child-nurse, having made him
comfortable, gave a sigh of relief, and looked up and down the
car with a radiant smile of content.&nbsp; Presto, change!&nbsp;
All the railroad magnates and clerks had been watching her over
their newspapers, and in one instant she had captured the
car.&nbsp; I saw tears in many eyes, and might have seen more had
not my own been full.&nbsp; There was apparently no reason for
the gay, winsome, enchanting smile that curved the red mouth,
brought two dimples into the brown cheeks, and sunny gleams into
two dark eyes.&nbsp; True, she was riding instead of walking, and
her charge was sleeping instead of waking and wailing; but these
surely were trifling matters on which to base such rare
content.&nbsp; Yet there it was shining in her face as she met a
dozen pairs of eyes, and saw in each of them love for her sweet
motherly little self, and love for the &ldquo;eternal
womanly&rdquo; of which she was the visible expression.&nbsp;
There was a general exodus at Brett Street, and every man
furtively slipped a piece of silver into the child&rsquo;s lap as
he left the car; each, I think, trying to hide his action from
the others.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is of threads such as these that I weave the fabric
of my daily happiness,&mdash;a happiness that my friends never
seem able to comprehend; the blindest of them pity me, indeed,
but I consider myself like Mary of old, &ldquo;blessed among
women.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Another day</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;God means all sorts of things
when he sends men and women into the world.&nbsp; That he means
marriage, and that it is the chiefest good, I have no doubt, but
it is the love forces in it that make it so.&nbsp; I may,
perhaps, reach my highest point of development without marriage,
but I can never do it unless I truly and deeply love somebody or
something.&nbsp; I am not sure, but it seems to me God intends me
for other people&rsquo;s children, not for my own.&nbsp; My heart
is so entirely in my work that I fancy I have none left for a
possible husband.&nbsp; If ever a man comes who is strong enough
and determined enough to sweep things aside and make a place for
himself willy-nilly, I shall ask him to come in and rest; but
that seems very unlikely.&nbsp; What man have I ever seen who
would help me to be the woman my work helps me to be?&nbsp; Of
course there are such, but the Lord keeps them safely away from
my humble notice, lest I should die of love or be guilty of
hero-worship.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Men are so dull, for the most part!&nbsp; They are
often tender and often loyal, but they seldom put any spiritual
leaven into their tenderness, and their loyalty is apt to be
rather unimaginative.&nbsp; Heigho!&nbsp; I wish we could make
lovers as the book-writers do, by rolling the virtues and graces
of two or three men into one!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d almost like to be a
man in this decade, a young, strong man, for there are such
splendid giants to slay!&nbsp; To be sure, a woman can always
buckle on the sword, and that is rather a delightful avocation,
after all; but somehow there are comparatively few men nowadays
who care greatly to wear swords or have them buckled on.&nbsp;
There is no inspiration in trying to buckle on the sword of a man
who never saw one, and who uses it wrong end foremost, and falls
down on it, and entangles his legs in it, and scratches his
lady&rsquo;s hand with it whenever he kisses her!&nbsp; And
therefore, these things, for aught I see, being unalterably so, I
will take children&rsquo;s love, woman&rsquo;s love, and
man&rsquo;s friendship; man&rsquo;s friendship, which, if it is
not life&rsquo;s poetry, is credible prose, says George
Meredith,&mdash;&ldquo;a land of low undulations, instead of
Alps, beyond the terrors and deceptions.&rdquo;&nbsp; That will
fill to overflowing my life, already so full, and in time I shall
grow from everybody&rsquo;s Mistress Mary into everybody&rsquo;s
Mother Mary, and that will be the end of me in my present state
of being.&nbsp; I am happy, yes, I am blessedly happy in this
prospect, and yet&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Another day</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;My beloved work!&nbsp; How
beautiful it is!&nbsp; Toniella has not brought little Nino this
week.&nbsp; She says he is ill, but that he sits every day in the
orchard, singing our songs and modelling birds from the lump of
clay we sent him.&nbsp; When I heard that phrase &ldquo;in the
orchard,&rdquo; I felt a curious sensation, for I know they live
in a tenement house; but I said nothing, and went to visit
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The orchard is a few plants in pots and pans on a
projecting window-sill!</p>
<p>&lsquo;My heart went down on its knees when I saw it.&nbsp;
The divine spark is in those children; it will be a moving power,
helping them to struggle out of their present environment into a
wider, sunnier one&mdash;the one of the real orchards.&nbsp; How
fresh, how full of possibilities, is the world to the people who
can keep the child heart, and above all to the people who are
able to see orchards in window-boxes!&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Another day</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;Lisa&rsquo;s daily lesson is
just finished.&nbsp; It was in arithmetic, and I should have lost
patience had it not been for her musical achievements this
morning.&nbsp; Edith played the airs of twenty or thirty games,
and without a word of help from us she associated the right
memory with each, and illustrated it with pantomime.&nbsp; In
some cases, she invented gestures of her own that showed deeper
intuition than ours; and when, last of all, the air of the
Carrier Doves was played, a vision of our Solitary must have come
before her mind.&nbsp; Her lip trembling, she held an imaginary
letter in her fingers, and, brushing back the hair from her
forehead (his very gesture!), she passed her hand across her
eyes, laid the make-believe note in Rhoda&rsquo;s apron, and
slipped out of the door without a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Man!&nbsp; Mr. Man!&nbsp; It is Mr. Man when
he couldn&rsquo;t read his letter!&rdquo; cried the
children.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he come to see us any
more, Miss Rhoda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He is doing some work for Miss Mary, I
think,&rdquo; answered Rhoda, with a teasing look at me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lisa came back just then, and rubbed her cheek against
my arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I went to the corner,&rdquo; she whispered,
&ldquo;but he wasn&rsquo;t there; he is never there
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was the remembrance of this astonishing morning that
gave me courage in the later lesson.&nbsp; She seems to have no
idea of numbers&mdash;there will be great difficulty
there,&mdash;but she begins to read well, and the marvel of it is
that she has various talents!&nbsp; She is weak, uneducated; many
things are either latent or altogether missing in her as yet, and
I do not know how many of them will appear, nor how long a
process it will be; but her mind is full of compensations, and
that is the last thing I expected.&nbsp; It is only with infinite
struggle that she <i>learns</i> anything, though she is capable
of struggle, and that is a good deal to say; but she has besides
a precious heritage of instincts and insights, hitherto
unsuspected and never drawn upon.&nbsp; It is precisely as if
there had been a bundle of possibilities folded away somewhere in
her brain, but hidden by an intervening veil, or crushed by some
alien weight.&nbsp; We seem to have drawn away that curtain or
lifted that weight, and the faculties so long obscured are
stretching themselves and growing with their new freedom.&nbsp;
It reminds me of the weak, stunted grass-blades under a
stone.&nbsp; I am always lifting it and rolling it away,
sentimentally trying to give the struggling shoots a
chance.&nbsp; One can see for many a long day where the stone has
been, but the grass forgets it after a while, when it breathes
the air and sunshine, tastes the dew and rain, and feels the
miracle of growth within its veins.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Another day</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;The twins are certainly
improving a trifle.&nbsp; They are by no means angelic, but they
are at least growing human; and if ever their tremendous
energy&mdash;a very whirlwind&mdash;is once turned in the right
direction, we shall see things move, I warrant you!&nbsp; Rhoda
says truly that the improvement cannot be seen with the naked
eye; but the naked eye is never in use with us, in our work, nor
indeed with the Father of Lights, who teaches us all to see truly
if we will.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The young minister has spent a morning with us.&nbsp;
He came to make my acquaintance, shook me warmly by the hand,
and&mdash;that was the last I saw of him, for he kept as close to
Rhoda&rsquo;s side as circumstances would permit!&nbsp; The naked
eye is all one needs to discern his motives!&nbsp; Psychological
observations, indeed!&nbsp; Child study, forsooth!&nbsp; It was
lovely to see Rhoda&rsquo;s freshness, spontaneity, and
unconsciousness, as she flitted about like a pretty
cardinal-bird.&nbsp; Poor young minister, whose heart is dangling
at the strings of her scarlet apron!&nbsp; Lucky young minister,
if his arm ever goes about that slender red-ribboned waist, and
his lips ever touch that glowing cheek!&nbsp; But poor me! what
will the garden be without our crimson rose?&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

MORE LEAVES</h2>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">It</span> has been one of the
discouraging days.&nbsp; Lisa was wilful; the twins had a moral
relapse; the young minister came again, and, oh, the interminable
length of time he held Rhoda&rsquo;s hand at parting!&nbsp; Is it
not strange that, with the whole universe to choose from, his
predatory eye must fall upon my blooming Rhoda?&nbsp; I wonder
whether the fragrance she will shed upon that one small parsonage
will be as widely disseminated as the sweetness she exhales here,
day by day, among our &ldquo;little people all in a
row&rdquo;?&nbsp; I am not sure; I hope so; at any rate,
selfishness must not be suffered to eclipse my common-sense, and
the young minister seems a promising, manly fellow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When we have had a difficult day, I go home and sit
down in my cosy corner in the twilight, the time and place where
I always repeat my <i>credo</i>, which is this:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the children of this year, of every new year, who
are to bring the full dawn, that dawn that has been growing since
first the world began.&nbsp; It is not only that children
re-create the world year by year, decade by decade, by making
over human nature; by transforming trivial, thoughtless men and
women into serious, earnest ones; by waking in arid natures
slumbering seeds of generosity, self-sacrifice, and
helpfulness.&nbsp; It is not alone in this way that children are
bringing the dawn of the perfect day.&nbsp; It is the children
(bless them! how naughty they were to-day!) who are going to do
all we have left undone, all we have failed to do, all we might
have done had we been wise enough, all we have been too weak and
stupid to do.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Among the thousands of tiny things growing up all over
the land, some of them under my very wing&mdash;watched and
tended, unwatched and untended, loved, unloved, protected from
danger, thrust into temptation, among them somewhere is the child
who will write a great poem that will live for ever and ever,
kindling every generation to a loftier ideal.&nbsp; There is the
child who will write the novel that is to stir men&rsquo;s hearts
to nobler issues and incite them to better deeds.&nbsp; There is
the child (perhaps it is Nino) who will paint the greatest
picture or carve the greatest statue of the age; another who will
deliver his country in an hour of peril; another who will give
his life for a great principle; and another, born more of the
spirit than the flesh, who will live continually on the heights
of moral being, and, dying, draw men after him.&nbsp; It may be I
shall preserve one of these children to the race&mdash;who
knows?&nbsp; It is a peg big enough on which to hang a hope, for
every child born into the world is a new incarnate thought of
God, an ever fresh and radiant possibility.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Another day</i>.&mdash;&lsquo;Would I had the gift to
capture Mrs. Grubb and put her between the covers of a
book!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It tickles Rhoda&rsquo;s fancy mightily that the Vague
Lady (as we call her) should take Lisa before the Commissioners
of Lunacy!&nbsp; Rhoda says that if she has an opportunity to
talk freely with them, they will inevitably jump at the
conclusion that Lisa has brought <i>her</i> for examination, as
she is so much the more irrational of the two!&nbsp; Rhoda
facetiously imagines a scene in which a reverend member of the
body takes Lisa aside and says solemnly, &ldquo;My dear child,
you have been wise beyond your years in bringing us your
guardian, and we cannot allow her to be at large another day,
lest she becomes suddenly violent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of late I have noticed that she has gradually dropped
one club and society after another, concentrating her attention
more and more upon Theosophy.&nbsp; Every strange weed and sucker
that can grow anywhere flourishes in the soil of her mind, and if
a germ of truth or common-sense does chance to exist in any
absurd theory, it is choked by the time it has lain there among
the underbrush for a little space; so that when she begins her
harvesting (which is always a long while before anything is
ripe), one can never tell precisely what sort of crop was
planted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems that the Theosophists are considering the
establishment of a colony of Mahatmas at Mojave, on the summit of
the Tehachapi Mountains.&nbsp; Their present habitat is the
Himalayas, but there is no reason why we should not encourage
them to settle in this country.&nbsp; The Tehachapis would give
as complete retirement as the Himalayas, while the spiritual
advantages to be derived from an infusion of Mahatmas into our
population are self-evident.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think, my
sisters,&rdquo; Mrs. Grubb would say, &ldquo;think, that our
mountain ranges may some time be peopled by omniscient beings
thousands of years old and still growing!&rdquo;&nbsp; Up to this
last aberration I have had some hope of Grubb o&rsquo;
Dreams.&nbsp; I thought it a good sign, her giving up so many
societies and meetings.&nbsp; The house is not any tidier, but at
least she stays in it occasionally.&nbsp; In the privacy of my
own mind I have been ascribing this slight reformation to the
most ordinary cause,&mdash;namely, a Particular Man.&nbsp; It
would never have occurred to me in her case had not Edith
received confidential advices from Mrs. Sylvester.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to lose her, I feel it!&rdquo;
said Mrs. Sylvester.&nbsp; &ldquo;I feel it, and she alludes to
it herself.&nbsp; There ain&rsquo;t but two ways of her classes
losing her, death and marriage; and as she looks too healthy to
die, it must be the other one.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s never accepted
any special attentions till about a month ago, when the Improved
Order of Red Men held their Great Council here.&nbsp; You see she
used to be Worthy Wenonah of Pocahontas Lodge years ago, when my
husband was Great Keeper of the Wampum, but she hasn&rsquo;t
attended regularly; a woman is so handicapped, when it comes to
any kind of public work, by her home and her children.&mdash;I do
hope I shall live long enough to see all those kind of harassing
duties performed in public, co-operative institutions.&mdash;She
went to the Council to keep me company, mostly, but the very
first evening I could see that William Burkhardt, of Bald Eagle
No. 62, was struck with her; she lights up splendidly, Mrs. Grubb
does.&nbsp; He stayed with her every chance he got during the
week: but I didn&rsquo;t see her give him any encouragement, and
I should never have thought of it again if she hadn&rsquo;t come
home late from one of the Council Fires at the Wigwam.&nbsp; I
was just shutting my bedroom blinds.&nbsp; I tried not to listen,
for I despise eavesdropping, of all things, but I couldn&rsquo;t
help hearing her say, &ldquo;No, Mr. Burkhardt, you are only a
Junior Sagamore, and I am ambitious.&nbsp; When you are a Great
Sachem, it will be time enough to consider the
matter.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Sylvester, Edith, and I agreed that this was most
significant, but we may have been mistaken, according to her
latest development.&nbsp; The &ldquo;passing away&rdquo; so
feelingly alluded to by Mrs. Sylvester is to be of a different
sort.&nbsp; She has spoken mysteriously to me before of her
reasons for denying herself luxuries; of the goal she expected to
reach through rigid denial of the body and training of the
spirit; of her longing to come less in contact with the foul
magnetism of the common herd, so detrimental to her growth; but
she formally announced to me in strict confidence to-day her
ambition to be a Mahatma.&nbsp; Of course she has been so many
things that there are comparatively few left; still, say whatever
we like, she has the spirit of all the Argonauts, that
woman!&nbsp; She has been an Initiate for some time, and
considers herself quite ready for the next step, which is to be a
Chela.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to state that she climbs the
ladder of evolution much faster than the ordinary Theosophist,
who is somewhat slow in his movements, and often deals in
centuries, or even &aelig;ons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not know that there were female Mahatmas,
reasoning unconsciously from the fact that an Adept is supposed
to hold his peace for many years before he can even contemplate
the possibility of being a Mahatma.&nbsp; (The idea of Grubb
o&rsquo; Dreams holding her peace is too absurd for
argument.)&nbsp; There are many grades of Adepts, it seems,
ranging from the &ldquo;topmost&rdquo; Mahatmas down.&nbsp; The
highest of all, the Nirmanakayas, are self-conscious without the
body, travelling hither and thither with but one object, that of
helping humanity.&nbsp; As we descend the scale, we find Adepts
(and a few second-class Mahatmas) living in the body, for the
wheel of Karma has not entirely revolved for them; but they have
a key to their &ldquo;prison&rdquo; (that is what Mrs. Grubb
calls her nice, pretty body!), and can emerge from it at
pleasure.&nbsp; That is, any really capable and energetic Adept
can project his soul from its prison to any place that he
pleases, with the rapidity of thought.&nbsp; I may have my
personal doubts as to the possibilities of this gymnastic feat,
but Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s intellectual somersaults have been of such
thoroughness and frequency that I am sure, if anybody can perform
the gyration, she can!&nbsp; Meantime, there are decades of
retirement, meditation, and preparation necessary, and she can
endure nothing of that sort in this present incarnation, so the
parting does not seem imminent!</p>
<p>&lsquo;She came to consult me about Soul Haven for the
twins.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it a wholly bad plan.&nbsp; The
country is better for them than the city; we can manage
occasional news of their welfare; it will tide to get over the
brief interval of time needed by Mrs. Grubb for growing into a
Chela; and in any event, they are sure to run away from the Haven
as soon as they become at all conscious of their souls, a moment
which I think will be considerably delayed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Grubb will not yield Lisa until she is certain
that the Soul Haven colonists will accept the twins without a
caretaker; but unless the matter is quietly settled by the new
year I shall find some heroic means of changing her mind.&nbsp; I
have considered the matter earnestly for many months without
knowing precisely how to find sufficient money for the
undertaking.&nbsp; My own income can be stretched to cover her
maintenance, but it is not sufficient to give her the proper sort
of education.&nbsp; She is beyond my powers now, and
perhaps&mdash;nay, of a certainty, if her health continue to
improve&mdash;five years of skilful teaching will make
her&mdash;what it will make her no one can prophesy, but it is
sure to be something worth working for.&nbsp; No doubt I can get
the money by a public appeal, and if it were for a dozen children
instead of one I would willingly do it, as indeed I have done it
many times in the past.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was a beautiful thought of Pastor Von
Bodelschwingh, of the Colony of Mercy in Germany.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Man&rdquo; told me about him in one of the very few
long talks we had together.&nbsp; He had a home for adults and
children of ailing mind and body, and when he wanted a new house
for the little ones, and there was no money to build or equip it,
he asked every parent in Germany for a thank-offering to the Lord
of one penny for each well child.&nbsp; Within a short fortnight
four hundred thousand pennies flowed in&mdash;four hundred
thousand thank-offerings for children strong and well.&nbsp; The
good pastor&rsquo;s wish was realised, and his Baby Castle an
accomplished fact.&nbsp; Not only did the four hundred thousand
pennies come, but the appeal for them stimulated a new sense of
gratitude among all the parents who responded, so that there came
pretty, touching messages from all sides, such as: &ldquo;Four
pennies for four living children; for a child in heaven,
two.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Six pennies for a happy
home.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;One penny for the child we never
had.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Five pennies for a good wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! never, surely, was a Baby Castle framed of such
lovely timber as this!&nbsp; It seems as if heaven&rsquo;s sweet
air must play about the towers, and heaven&rsquo;s sunshine
stream in at every window, of a house built from turret to
foundation-stone of such royal material.&nbsp; The Castle might
look like other castles, but every enchanted brick and stone and
block of wood, every grain of mortar, every bit of glass and
marble, unlike all others of its kind, would be transformed by
the thought it represented and thrilled with the message it
bore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such an appeal I could make for my whole great family,
but somehow this seems almost a private matter, and I am
sensitive about giving it publicity.&nbsp; My love and hope for
Lisa are so great, I cannot bear to describe her
&ldquo;case,&rdquo; nor paint her unhappy childhood in the hues
it deserves, for the sake of gaining sympathy and aid.&nbsp; I
may have to do it, but would I were the little Croesus of a
day!&nbsp; Still, Christmas is coming, and who knows?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Everywhere the Feast o&rsquo; the Babe,<br
/>
Joy upon earth, peace and good-will to men!<br />
We are baptized.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Merry Christmas is coming.&nbsp; Everybody&rsquo;s hand-grasp
is warmer because of it, though of course it is the children
whose merriment rings truest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are just one or two things, grown up as I am,
that I should like to find in the toe of my stocking on Christmas
morning; only they are impalpable things that could neither be
put in nor taken out of real stockings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old as we are, we are most of us mere children in this,
that we go on hoping that next Christmas all the delicious
happenings we have missed in other Christmases may descend upon
us by the old and reliable chimney-route!&nbsp; A Santa Claus
that had any bowels of compassion would rush down the narrowest
and sootiest chimney in the world to give me my simple
wishes.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t as if I were petitioning nightly for
a grand house, a yacht, a four-in-hand, a diamond necklace, and a
particular man for a husband; but I don&rsquo;t see that modesty
finds any special favour with St. Nick.&nbsp; Now and then I
harbour a rascally suspicion that he is an indolent, time-serving
person, who slips down the widest, cleanest chimneys to the
people who clamour the loudest; but this abominable cynicism
melts into thin air the moment that I look at his jolly visage on
the cover of a picture-book.&nbsp; Dear, fat, rosy, radiant
Being!&nbsp; Surely he is incapable of any but the highest
motives!&nbsp; I am twenty-eight years old, but age shall never
make any difference in the number or extent of my
absurdities.&nbsp; I am going to write a letter and send it up
the chimney!&nbsp; It never used to fail in the long-ago; but ah!
then there were two dear, faithful go-betweens to interpret my
childish messages of longing to Santa Claus, and jog his memory
at the critical time!&rsquo;</p>

&lsquo;THE FEAST O&rsquo; THE BABE&rsquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was sure to be a green Christmas
in that sunny land, but not the sort of &lsquo;green Yule&rsquo;
that makes the &lsquo;fat kirkyard.&rsquo;&nbsp; If the New
Englanders who had been transplanted to that shore of the Pacific
ever longed for a bracing snowstorm, for frost pictures on the
window-panes, for the breath of a crystal air blown over
ice-fields&mdash;an air that nipped the ears, but sent the blood
coursing through the veins, and made the turkey and cranberry
sauce worth eating,&mdash;the happy children felt no lack, and
basked contentedly in the soft December sunshine.&nbsp; Still
further south there were mothers who sighed even more for the
sound of merry sleigh-bells, the snapping of logs on the hearth,
the cosy snugness of a fire-lit room made all the snugger by the
fierce wind without: that, if you like, was a place to hang a row
of little red and brown woollen stockings!&nbsp; And when the
fortunate children on the eastern side of the Rockies, tired of
resisting the Sand Man, had snuggled under the great down
comforters and dropped off to sleep, they dreamed, of course, of
the proper Christmas things&mdash;of the tiny feet of reindeer
pattering over the frozen crust, the tinkle of silver bells on
their collars, the real Santa Claus with icicles in his beard,
with red cheeks, and a cold nose, and a powder of snow on his
bearskin coat, and with big fur mittens never too clumsy to take
the toys from his pack.</p>
<p>Here the air blew across orange groves and came laden with the
sweetness of opening buds; here, if it were a sunny Christmas
Day, as well it might be, the children came in to dinner tired
with playing in the garden: but the same sort of joyous cries
that rent the air three thousand miles away at sight of hot
plum-pudding woke the echoes here because of fresh strawberries
and loquats; and although, in the minds of the elders, who had
been born in snowdrifts and bred upon icicles, this union of
balmy air, singing birds, and fragrant bloom might strike a false
note at Christmastide, it brought nothing but joy to the
children.&nbsp; After all, if it were not for old
associations&rsquo; sake, it would seem that one might fitly
celebrate the birthday of the Christ-child under sunshine as warm
and skies of the same blue as those that sheltered the heavenly
Babe in old Judea.</p>
<p>During the late days of October and the early days of November
the long drought of summer had been broken, and it had rained
steadily, copiously, refreshingly.&nbsp; Since then there had
been day after day of brilliant, cloudless sunshine, and the
moist earth, warmed gratefully through to the marrow, stirred and
trembled and pushed forth myriads of tender shoots from the seeds
that were hidden in its bosom; and the tender shoots themselves
looked up to the sun, and, with their roots nestled in sweet,
fragrant beds of richness, thought only of growing tall and
green, dreamed only of the time when pink pimpernels would bloom
between their waving blades, and when tribes of laughing children
would come to ramble over the hillsides.&nbsp; The streets of the
city were full of the fragrance of violets, for the
flower-vendors had great baskets of them over their arms, and
every corner tempted the passers-by with the big odorous purple
bunches that offered a royal gift of sweetness for every penny
invested.</p>
<p>Atlantic and Pacific Simonson had previously known little, and
Marm Lisa less, of Christmas-time, but the whole month of
December in Mistress Mary&rsquo;s garden was a continual feast of
the new-born Babe.&nbsp; There was an almost oppressive
atmosphere of secrecy abroad.&nbsp; Each family of children,
working in the retirement of its particular corner, would shriek,
&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t come!&rsquo; and hide small objects under
pinafores and tables when Mary, Rhoda, Edith, or Helen
appeared.&nbsp; The neophyte in charge was always in the attitude
of a surprised hen, extending her great apron to its utmost area
as a screen to hide these wonderful preparations.&nbsp;
Edith&rsquo;s group was slaving over Helen&rsquo;s gift,
Rhoda&rsquo;s over Edith&rsquo;s, and so on, while all the groups
had some marvellous bit of co-operative work in hand for Mistress
Mary.&nbsp; At the afternoon council, the neophytes were obliged
to labour conscientiously on presents destined for themselves,
rubbing off stains, disentangling knots, joining threads, filling
up wrong holes and punching right ones, surreptitiously getting
the offerings of love into a condition where the energetic
infants could work on them again.&nbsp; It was somewhat difficult
to glow and pale with surprise when they received these
well-known and well-worn trophies of skill from the tree at the
proper time, but they managed to achieve it.</p>
<p>Never at any other season was there such a scrubbing of paws,
and in spite of the most devoted sacrifices to the Moloch of
cleanliness the excited little hands grew first moist, and then
grimy, nobody knew how.&nbsp; &lsquo;It must leak out of the
inside of me,&rsquo; wailed Bobby Baxter when sent to the pump
for the third time one morning; but he went more or less
cheerfully, for his was the splendid honour of weaving a frame
for Lisa&rsquo;s picture, and he was not the man to grudge an
inch or two of skin if thereby he might gain a glorious
immortality.</p>
<p>The principal conversation during this festival time consisted
of phrases like: &lsquo;I know what you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to
have, Miss Edith, but I won&rsquo;t tell!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Miss Mary, Sally &rsquo;most told Miss Rhoda what she was
makin&rsquo; for her.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Miss Helen, Pat Higgins
went right up to Miss Edith and asked her to help him mend the
leg of his clay frog, and it&rsquo;s his own Christmas present to
her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The children could not for the life of them play birds, or
butterflies, or carpenter, or scissors-grinder, for they wanted
to shout the live-long day&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Christmas bells are ringing sweet,<br />
We too the happy day must greet&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Under the holly, now,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sing and be jolly, now,<br />
Christmas has come and the children are glad&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Hurrah
for Santa Claus!<br />
Long may he live at his castle in Somewhere-land!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was much whispering and discussion about evergreens and
garlands and wreaths that were soon to come, and much serious
planning with regard to something to be made for mother, father,
sister, brother, and the baby; something, too, now and then, for
a grandpapa in Sweden, a grandmamma in Scotland, a Norwegian
uncle, an Irish aunt, and an Italian cousin; but there was never
by chance any cogitation as to what the little workers themselves
might get.&nbsp; In the happier homes among them, there was
doubtless the usual legitimate speculation as to doll or drum,
but here in this enchanted spot, this materialised Altruria, the
talk was all of giving, when the Wonderful Tree bloomed in their
midst&mdash;the Wonderful Tree they sang about every morning,
with the sweet voice</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;telling
its branches among<br />
Of shepherd&rsquo;s watch and of angel&rsquo;s song,<br />
Of lovely Babe in manger low,&mdash;<br />
The beautiful story of long ago,<br />
When a radiant star threw its beams so wide<br />
To herald the earliest Christmastide.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Tree was coming&mdash;Mistress Mary said so; and bless my
heart, you might possibly meddle with the revolution of the earth
around the sun, or induce some weak-minded planet to go the wrong
way, but you would be helpless to reverse one of Mistress
Mary&rsquo;s promises!&nbsp; They were as fixed and as
unchangeable as the laws of the Medes and Persians, and there was
a record of their fulfilment indelibly written in the memories of
two hundred small personages&mdash;personages in whom adult
caprice and flexibility of conduct had bred a tendency to
suspicion.</p>
<p>The Tree, therefore, had been coming for a fortnight, and on
the 22nd it came!&nbsp; Neither did it come alone, for it was
accompanied by a forest of holly and mistletoe, and ropes of
evergreen, and wreaths and garlands of laurel, and green stars by
the dozen.&nbsp; And in a great box, at present hidden from the
children, were heaps of candles, silver and crystal baubles,
powdered snowflakes, glass icicles, gilded nuts, parti-coloured
spheres, cornucopias full of goodies, and, above all, two
wonderful Christmas angels, and a snow-white dove!</p>
<p>Neither tree, nor garlands, nor box contained any hint of the
donor, to the great disappointment of the neophytes.&nbsp; Rhoda
had an idea, for Cupid had &lsquo;clapped her i&rsquo; the
shoulder,&rsquo; and her intuitions were preternaturally keen
just now.&nbsp; Mary almost knew, though she had never been in
love in her life, and her faculties were working only in their
every-day fashion; but she was not in the least surprised when
she drew a letter from under the white dove&rsquo;s wing.&nbsp;
Seeing that it was addressed to her, she waited until everybody
had gone, and sat under the pepper-tree in the deserted
playground, where she might read it in solitude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mistress Mary</span>,&rsquo;
it said, &lsquo;do you care to hear of my life?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pas Ewig-Weibliche<br />
Zieht uns hinan,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I am growing olives.&nbsp; Do you remember what the
Spanish monk said to the tree that he pruned, and that cried out
under his hook? &ldquo;It is not beauty that is wanted of you,
nor shade, but olives.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sun is hot, and it has
not rained for many a long week, it seems to me, but the dew of
your influence falls ever sweet and fresh on the dust of my daily
task.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Enclosed please find the wherewithal for Lisa&rsquo;s
next step higher.&nbsp; As she needs more it will come.&nbsp; I
give it for sheer gratitude, as the good folk gave their pennies
to Pastor Von Bodelschwingh.&nbsp; Why am I grateful?&nbsp; For
your existence, to be sure!&nbsp; I had lived my life haunted by
the feeling that there was such a woman, and finally the
mysterious wind of destiny blew me to her, &ldquo;as the tempest
brings the rose-tree to the pollard willow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not be troubled about me, little
mother-of-many!&nbsp; There was once upon a time a common mallow
by the roadside, and being touched by Mohammed&rsquo;s garment as
he passed, it was changed at once into a geranium; and best of
all, it remained a geranium for ever after.</p>

CLEANSING FIRES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the afternoon of the day
before Christmas, and all the little people had gone home,
leaving the room vacant for the decking of the Wonderful
Tree.&nbsp; Edith, Helen, and others were perched on
step-ladders, festooning garlands and wreaths from window to
window and post to post.&nbsp; Mary and Rhoda were hanging
burdens of joy among the green branches of the tree.</p>
<p>The room began to look more and more lovely as the evergreen
stars were hung by scarlet ribbons in each of the twelve windows,
and the picture-frames were crowned with holly branches.&nbsp;
Then Mistress Mary was elevated to a great height on a pyramid of
tables and chairs, and suspended the two Christmas angels by
invisible wires from the ceiling.&nbsp; When the chorus of
admiration had subsided, she took the white dove from
Rhoda&rsquo;s upstretched hands (and what a charming Christmas
picture they made&mdash;the eager, upturned rosy face of the one,
the gracious fairness of the other!), and laying its soft breast
against her cheek for a moment, perched it on the topmost branch
of waving green with a thought of &lsquo;Mr. Man,&rsquo; and a
hope that the blessed day might bring him a tithe of the cheer he
had given them.&nbsp; The effect of the dove and the angels was
so electrical that all the fresh young voices burst into the
chorus of the children&rsquo;s hymn:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He was born upon this day<br />
In David&rsquo;s town so far away,<br />
He the good and loving One,<br />
Mary&rsquo;s ever-bless&egrave;d Son.</p>
<p>Let us all our voices lend,<br />
For he was the children&rsquo;s Friend,<br />
He so lovely, He so mild,<br />
Jesus, bless&egrave;d Christmas Child!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the last line of the chorus floated through the open
windows, an alarm of fire sounded, followed by a jangle of bells
and a rumble of patrol wagons.&nbsp; On going to the west window,
Edith saw a blaze of red light against the sky, far in the
distance, in the direction of Lone Mountain.&nbsp; Soon after,
almost on the heels of the first, came another alarm with its
attendant clangings, its cries of &lsquo;Fire!&rsquo; its
chatterings and conjectures, its rushing of small boys in all
directions, its tread of hurrying policemen, its hasty flinging
up of windows and grouping of heads therein.</p>
<p>The girls were too busy labelling the children&rsquo;s gifts
to listen attentively to the confused clamour in the
streets,&mdash;fires were common enough in a city built of wood;
but when, half an hour after the first and second alarms, a third
sounded, they concluded it must be a conflagration, and Rhoda,
dropping her nuts and cornucopias, ran to the corner for
news.&nbsp; She was back again almost immediately, excited and
breathless.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Mary!&rsquo; she exclaimed, her hand on her panting
side, &lsquo;unless they are mistaken, it is three separate
fires: one, a livery-stable and carriage-house out towards Lone
Mountain; another fearful one on Telegraph Hill&mdash;a whole
block of houses, and they haven&rsquo;t had enough help there
because of the Lone Mountain fire; now there&rsquo;s a third
alarm, and they say it&rsquo;s at the corner of Sixth and Dutch
streets.&nbsp; If it is, we have a tenement house next door;
isn&rsquo;t that clothing-place on the corner?&nbsp; Yes, I know
it is; make haste!&nbsp; Edith and Helen will watch the Christmas
things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary did not need to be told to hasten.&nbsp; She had her hat
in her hand and was on the sidewalk before Rhoda had fairly
finished her sentence.</p>
<p>They hurried through the streets, guided by the cloud of smoke
that gushed from the top of a building in the near
distance.&nbsp; Almost everybody was running in the opposite
direction, attracted by the Telegraph Hill fire that flamed
vermilion and gold against the grey sky, looking from its
elevation like a mammoth bonfire, or like a hundred sunsets
massed in one lurid pile of colour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it the Golden Gate tenement house?&rsquo; they asked
of the neighbourhood locksmith, who was walking rapidly towards
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s the coat factory next door,&rsquo; he
answered hurredly.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be so much
of a blaze if they could get the fire company here to put it out
before it gets headway; but it&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; those blind
fires that&rsquo;s been sizzling away inside the walls for an
hour.&nbsp; The folks didn&rsquo;t know they was afire till a
girl ran in and told &rsquo;em&mdash;your Lisa it was,&mdash;and
they didn&rsquo;t believe her at first; but it warn&rsquo;t a
minute before the flames burst right through the plastering in
half a dozen places to once.&nbsp; I tell you they just dropped
everything where it was and run for their lives.&nbsp; There
warn&rsquo;t but one man on the premises, and he was such a
blamed fool he wasted five minutes trying to turn the alarm into
the letter-box on the lamp-post, &rsquo;stead of the right one
alongside.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going home for some tools&mdash;Hullo!
there&rsquo;s the flames coming through one corner o&rsquo; the
roof; that&rsquo;s the last o&rsquo; the factory, I guess; but it
ain&rsquo;t much loss, any way; it&rsquo;s a regular
sweatin&rsquo;-shop.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll let it go now, and try
to save the buildings each side of it&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
they&rsquo;ll do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That is what they were doing when Mary and Rhoda broke away
from the voluble locksmith in the middle of his discourse and
neared the scene of excitement.&nbsp; The firemen had not yet
come, though it was rumoured that a detachment was on the
way.&nbsp; All the occupants of the tenement house were taking
their goods and chattels out&mdash;running down the narrow
stairways with feather-beds, dropping clocks and china ornaments
from the windows, and endangering their lives by crawling down
the fire-escapes with small articles of no value.&nbsp; Men were
scarce at that hour in that locality, but there was a good
contingent of small shopkeepers and gentlemen-of-steady-leisure,
who were on the roof pouring-water over wet blankets and
comforters and carpets.&nbsp; A crazy-looking woman in the fourth
story kept dipping a child&rsquo;s handkerchief in and out of a
bowl of water and wrapping it about a tomato-can with a rosebush
planted in it.&nbsp; Another, very much intoxicated, leaned from
her window, and, regarding the whole matter as an agreeable
entertainment, called down humorous remarks and ribald jokes to
the oblivious audience.&nbsp; There was an improvised
hook-and-ladder company pouring water where it was least needed,
and a zealous self-appointed commanding officer who did nothing
but shout contradictory orders; but as nobody obeyed them, and
every man did just as he was inclined, it did not make any
substantial difference in the result.</p>
<p>Mary and Rhoda made their way through the mass of interested
spectators, not so many here as on the cooler side of the
street.&nbsp; Where was Lisa?&nbsp; That was the first, indeed
the only question.&nbsp; How had she come there?&nbsp; Where had
she gone?&nbsp; There was a Babel of confusion, but nothing like
the uproar that would have been heard had not part of the
district&rsquo;s population fled to the more interesting fire,
and had not the whole thing been so quiet and so lightning-quick
in its progress.&nbsp; The whole scene now burst upon their
view.&nbsp; A few harassed policemen had stretched ropes across
the street, and were trying to keep back the rebellious ones in
the crowd who ever and anon would struggle under the line and
have to be beaten back by force.</p>
<p>As Mary and Rhoda approached, a group on the outskirts cried
out, &lsquo;Here she is!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t more &rsquo;n
a minute sence they went to tell her!&nbsp; Here she is
now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The expected fire-brigade could hardly be called
&lsquo;she,&rsquo; Mary thought, as she glanced over her
shoulder.&nbsp; She could see no special reason for any interest
in her own movements.&nbsp; She took advantage of the parting of
the crowd, however, and as she made her way she heard, as in a
waking dream, disjointed sentences that had no meaning at first,
but being pieced together grew finally into an awful whole.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t the factory girls bring &rsquo;em
out?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t know they was there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say, one of &rsquo;em was saved, warn&rsquo;t
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which one of &rsquo;em did she get down before the roof
caught?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t no such thing; the
manager&rsquo;s across the bay; she gave the alarm
herself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She didn&rsquo;t know they was in there; I bet yer
they&rsquo;d run and hid, and she was hunting &rsquo;em when she
seen the smoke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, she did; she dropped the girl twin out of the
second-story window into Abe Isaac&rsquo;s arms, but she
didn&rsquo;t know the boy was in the building till just now, and
they can&rsquo;t hardly hold her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s foolish, anyhow, ain&rsquo;t
she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary staggered beyond Rhoda to the front of the crowd.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me under the rope!&rsquo; she cried, with a
mother&rsquo;s very wail in her tone&mdash;&lsquo;let me under
the rope, for God&rsquo;s sake!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re my
children!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this moment she heard a stentorian voice call to some one,
&lsquo;Wait a minute till the firemen get here, and they&rsquo;ll
go for him!&nbsp; Come back, girl, d-n you! you shan&rsquo;t
go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; <i>Not</i> wait!&rsquo; cried
Lisa, tearing herself dexterously from the policeman&rsquo;s
clutches, and dashing like a whirlwind up the tottering stairway
before any one else could gather presence of mind to seize and
detain her.</p>
<p>Pacific was safe on the pavement, but she had only a moment
before been flung from those flaming windows, and her terrified
shrieks rent the air.&nbsp; The crowd gave a long-drawn groan,
and mothers turned their eyes away and shivered.&nbsp; Nobody
followed Marm Lisa up that flaming path of death and duty: it was
no use flinging a good life after a worthless one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fool! crazy fool!&rsquo; people ejaculated, with tears
of reverence in their eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Darling, splendid fool!&rsquo; cried Mary.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Fool worth all the wise ones among us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He that loseth his life for My sake shall find
it!&rsquo; said a pious Methodist cobbler with a patched boot
under his arm.</p>
<p>In the eternity of waiting that was numbered really but in
seconds, a burly policeman beckoned four men and gave them a big
old-fashioned counterpane that some one had offered, telling them
to stand ready for whatever might happen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come closer, boys,&rsquo; said one of them, wetting his
hat in a tub of water; &lsquo;if we take a little scorchin&rsquo;
doin&rsquo; this now, we may git it cooler in the next
world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Amen!&nbsp; Trust the Lord!&rsquo; said the cobbler;
and just then Marm Lisa appeared at one of the top windows with a
child in her arms.&nbsp; No one else could have recognised
Atlantic in the smoke, but Rhoda and Mary knew the round cropped
head and the familiar blue gingham apron.</p>
<p>Lisa stood in the empty window-frame, a trembling figure on a
background of flame.&nbsp; Her post was not at the moment in
absolute danger.&nbsp; There was hope yet, though to the
onlookers there seemed none.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Throw him!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Drop him!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Le&rsquo; go of him!&rsquo; shouted the crowd.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold your jaws, and let me do the talking!&rsquo;
roared the policeman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stop your noise, if you
don&rsquo;t want two dead children on your consciences!&nbsp;
Keep back, you brutes, keep back o&rsquo; the rope, or I&rsquo;ll
club you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was not so much the officer&rsquo;s threats as simple,
honest awe that caused a sudden hush to fall.&nbsp; There were
whisperings, sighs, tears, murmurings, but all so subdued that it
seemed like silence in the midst of the fierce crackling of the
flames.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Drop him!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll ketch him in the
quilt!&rsquo; called the policeman, standing as near as he
dared.</p>
<p>Lisa looked shudderingly at the desperate means of salvation
so far below, and, turning her face away as much as she could,
unclasped her arms despairingly, and Atlantic came swooping down
from their shelter, down, down into the counterpane; stunned,
stifled, choked by smoke, but uninjured, as Lisa knew by the
cheers that greeted his safe descent.</p>
<p>A tongue of fire curled round the corner of the building and
ran up to the roof towards another that was licking its way along
the top of the window.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jump now yourself!&rsquo; called the policeman, while
two more men silently joined the four holding the corners of the
quilt.&nbsp; Every eye was fixed on the motionless figure of Marm
Lisa, who had drawn her shawl over her head, as if just conscious
of nearer heat.</p>
<p>The wind changed, and blew the smoke away from her
figure.&nbsp; The men on the roof stopped work, not caring for
the moment whether they saved the tenement house or not, since a
human life was hanging in the balance.&nbsp; The intoxicated
woman threw a beer-bottle into the street, and her son ran up
from the crowd and locked her safely in her kitchen at the back
of the house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jump this minute, or you&rsquo;re a dead girl!&rsquo;
shouted the officer, hoarse with emotion.&nbsp; &lsquo;God
A&rsquo;mighty, she ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to
jump&mdash;she&rsquo;s terror-struck!&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll burn
right there before our eyes, when we could climb up and drag her
down if we had a long enough ladder!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;ve found another ladder and are tying two
together,&rsquo; somebody said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fire company&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;!&nbsp; I hear
&rsquo;em!&rsquo; cried somebody else.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;ll be too late,&rsquo; moaned Rhoda,
&lsquo;too late!&nbsp; Oh, Mary, make her jump!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lisa had felt no fear while she darted through smoke and over
charred floors in pursuit of Atlantic&mdash;no fear, nothing but
joy when she dragged him out from under bench and climbed to the
window-sill with him,&mdash;but now that he was saved she seemed
paralysed.&nbsp; So still she was, she might have been a carven
statue save for the fluttering of the garments about her thin
childish legs.&nbsp; The distance to the ground looked
impassable, and she could not collect her thoughts for the
hissing of the flame as it ate up the floor in the room behind
her.&nbsp; Horrible as it was, she thought it would be easier to
let it steal behind her and wrap her in its burning embrace than
to drop from these dizzy heights down through that terrible
distance, to hear her own bones snap as she touched the quilt,
and to see her own blood staining the ground.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;ll burn, sure,&rsquo; said a man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, she&rsquo;s half-witted&mdash;that&rsquo;s one
comfort!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary started as if she were stung, and forced her way still
nearer to the window; hoping to gain a position where she could
be more plainly seen.</p>
<p>Everybody thought something was going to happen.&nbsp; Mary
had dozens of friends and more acquaintances in that motley
assemblage, and they somehow felt that there were dramatic
possibilities in the situation.&nbsp; Unless she could think of
something, Marm Lisa&rsquo;s last chance was gone: that was the
sentiment of the crowd, and Mary agreed in it.</p>
<p>Her cape had long since dropped from her shoulders, her hat
was trampled under foot, the fair coil of hair had loosened and
was falling on her neck, and the steel fillet blazed in the
firelight.&nbsp; She stepped to the quilt and made a despairing
movement to attract Lisa&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Li-sa!&rsquo; she called, in that sweet, carrying
woman&rsquo;s voice that goes so much further than a
man&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The child started, and, pushing back the shawl, looked out
from under its cover, her head raised, her eyes brightening.</p>
<p>Mary chanced all on that one electrical moment of recognition,
and, with a mien half commanding and half appealing, she
stretched out both her arms and called again, while the crowd
held its breath:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come to me, darling!&nbsp; Jump, little sister!
<i>now</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not one second did Marm Lisa hesitate.&nbsp; She would have
sprung into the fire at that dear mandate, and, closing her eyes,
she leaped into the air as the roof above her head fell in with a
crash.</p>
<p>Just then the beating of hoofs and jangling of bells in the
distance announced the coming of the belated firemen; not so long
belated actually, for all the emotions, heart-beats, terrors, and
despairs that go to make up tragedy can be lived through in a few
brief moments.</p>
<p>In that sudden plunge from window to earth Marm Lisa seemed to
die consciously.&nbsp; The grey world, the sad world, vanished,
&lsquo;and the immortal light, all young and joyful,
million-orbed, million-coloured,&rsquo; beamed on her
darkness.&nbsp; She kept on falling, falling, falling, till she
reached the abysmal depths of space&mdash;then she knew no more:
and Mary, though prone on the earth, kept falling, falling,
falling with her into so deep a swoon that she woke only to find
herself on a friendly bed, with Rhoda and Lisa herself, weeping
over her.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At five o&rsquo;clock, Mrs. Grubb, forcibly torn from a
meeting and acquainted with the afternoon&rsquo;s proceedings,
hurried into a lower room in the tenement house, where Mary,
Rhoda, and the three children were gathered for a time.&nbsp;
There were still a hundred people in the street, but they showed
their respect by keeping four or five feet away from the
windows.</p>
<p>The twins sat on a sofa, more quiet than anything save death
itself.&nbsp; They had been rocked to the very centre of their
being, and looked like nothing so much as a couple of faded
photographs of themselves.&nbsp; Lisa lay on a cot, sleeping
restlessly; Mary looked pale and wan, and there were dark circles
under her eyes.</p>
<p>As Mrs. Grubb opened the door softly, Mary rose to meet
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you heard all?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, everything!&rsquo; faltered Mrs. Grubb with
quivering lips and downcast eyelids.</p>
<p>Mary turned towards Lisa&rsquo;s bed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mrs.
Grubb,&rsquo; she said, looking straight into that lady&rsquo;s
clear, shallow eyes, &lsquo;I think Lisa has earned her freedom,
and the right to ask a Christmas gift of you.&nbsp; Stand on the
other side of the cot and put your hand in mine.&nbsp; I ask you
for the last time, will you give this unfinished, imperfect life
into my keeping, if I promise to be faithful to it unto the end,
whatever it may be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I suppose that every human creature, be he ever so paltry, has
his hour of effulgence, an hour when the mortal veil grows thin
and the divine image stands revealed, endowing him, for a brief
space at least with a kind of awful beauty and majesty.</p>
<p>It was Mistress Mary&rsquo;s hour.&nbsp; Her pure, unswerving
spirit shone with a white and steady radiance that illuminated
Mrs. Grubb&rsquo;s soul to its very depths, showing her in a
flash the feeble flickerings and waverings of her own trivial
purposes.&nbsp; At that moment her eye was fitted with a new
lens, through which the road to the summit of the Tehachapi
Mountains and Mahatmadom suddenly looked long, weary, and
profitless, and by means of which the twins were transferred from
the comfortable middle distance they had previously occupied to
the immediate foreground of duty.&nbsp; The lens might slip, but
while it was in place she saw as clearly as another woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you?&rsquo; repeated Mistress Mary, wondering at
her silence.</p>
<p>Mrs. Grubb gave one last glance at the still reproach of
Lisa&rsquo;s face, and one more at the twins, who seemed to loom
more formidably each time she regarded them; then drawing a deep
breath she said, &lsquo;Yes, I will; I <i>will</i>, no matter
what happens; but it isn&rsquo;t enough to give up, and you
needn&rsquo;t suppose I think it is.&rsquo;&nbsp; And taking a
passive twin by either hand, she passed out of the door into the
crowded thoroughfare, and disappeared in the narrow streets that
led to Eden Place.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
